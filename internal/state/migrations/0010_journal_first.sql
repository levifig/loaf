-- SPEC-056 journal-first: the project journal replaces the session entity.
-- Destructive and idempotent. Backfills harness_session_id onto journal rows,
-- purges lifecycle-noise entries, drops the session FK columns/tables, and
-- rebuilds the journal FTS index keyed on harness_session_id.
--
-- Ordering note: PRAGMA foreign_keys is a no-op inside a transaction, and
-- ApplyMigrations runs every migration inside one transaction. The rebuilds
-- below therefore drop the session FK columns from handoffs and journal_entries
-- BEFORE dropping the sessions table, so no live foreign key references the
-- sessions table at COMMIT. SQLite's DROP TABLE does not enforce child->parent
-- foreign keys, so intermediate states inside the transaction are safe.

-- (1) Backfill harness_session_id from the owning session record.
UPDATE journal_entries
SET harness_session_id = (
  SELECT s.harness_session_id FROM sessions s WHERE s.id = journal_entries.session_id
)
WHERE harness_session_id IS NULL
  AND session_id IS NOT NULL
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sessions s
    WHERE s.id = journal_entries.session_id AND s.harness_session_id IS NOT NULL
  );

-- (2) Purge lifecycle-noise entries safely. entry_type='session' was the
-- lifecycle machinery's bookkeeping type; on this installation every such row is
-- a machine-generated marker or auto-summary. But an unconditional
-- `DELETE FROM journal_entries WHERE entry_type='session'` would also destroy any
-- user-authored session(...) row on some other installation. So instead of
-- trusting the type blindly, we enumerate the exact machine-generated shapes and
-- purge ONLY those; anything typed 'session' that does not match is preserved by
-- renaming its entry_type to 'legacy_session' (content untouched). The 'session'
-- type still dies; unknown human content survives and is re-indexed by the FTS
-- rebuild in step (8) like any other row.
--
-- The machine shapes were derived empirically from the production journal
-- (entry_type='session' rows). Each family is anchored on both scope and message
-- so a coincidental human message under a lifecycle scope is not swept up:
--   start   : "=== SESSION STARTED ==="  [+ optional " (session <hex>)"]
--   resume  : "=== SESSION RESUMED ==="   [+ optional " (session <hex>)"]
--   stop    : "=== SESSION STOPPED ===" | "=== SESSION COMPLETE ==="
--   clear   : "=== CONTEXT CLEARED ==="
--   end / conclude / wrap (machine auto-summaries, NOT the deliberate
--            entry_type='wrap' synthesis rows, which are a different type):
--            "at commit <hash>[, N commits][, N decisions][, N entries]"
--            | "session ended"
--            | "closed by new conversation"
--            | "session handed off, pending final status update"
--   context : "from commit <hash>"  arrival stamps
--   merge   : "consolidated from <file>.md"  housekeeping records
--   test    : "verify session type"  fixture
--   enrich  : "recorded native SQLite enrichment checkpoint"
--
-- Deliberate synthesis ("tried X, abandoned Y, next Z") lives in entry_type='wrap'
-- rows (SPEC-056 §Solution Direction) and is never touched: we only ever read or
-- rewrite entry_type='session'.

-- (2a) Preserve any entry_type='session' row that is NOT a known machine shape
-- by demoting it to 'legacy_session'. Runs before the purge so unknown human
-- content is already off the 'session' type when the DELETE fires.
