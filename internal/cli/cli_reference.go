  Documents how agents operate the Loaf CLI: command discovery via loaf --help, JSON diagnosis surfaces, config-aware maintenance, and troubleshooting. Use when unsure which loaf command to invoke, how to validate project state, or when asked to upgrade, diagnose, repair, configure, or bring a Loaf project current. Not for workflow guidance (workflow skills own their CLI contracts) or build internals.

The Loaf operating manual for agents: how to discover commands, diagnose project state, and keep configuration current. It teaches reading the CLI, not memorizing it.

**Note:** This file is auto-generated from native CLI reference metadata. Do not edit manually.

		"## Operating Rules",
		"",
		"- Get exact, current syntax live: `loaf --help` lists every command, `loaf <command> --help` details one. This index is a map, not the contract.",
		"- Prefer `--json` surfaces when diagnosing: `loaf config check --json`, `loaf state doctor --json`. Parse the structured output instead of scraping human-readable text.",
		"- Run the deterministic CLI command before hand-editing anything it manages; the command owns its files.",
		"- Use `--fix` only for safe, mechanical repairs, and review what it changed.",
		"- Ask the user for project-owned choices — GitHub account, native tracker destination and routing hints, which harnesses to install — never guess them.",
		"- Never hand-edit Loaf-managed hook files; regenerate them through `loaf build` and `loaf install`.",
		"- Re-run the relevant check after any change and confirm it passes.",
		"- Log meaningful decisions to the journal: `loaf journal log \"decision(scope): ...\"`.",
		"",
		"## Journal Context (contract v2)",
		"",
		"`loaf journal context` is an active-truth read model, not the former latest-arbitrary-wrap plus branch entries plus open tasks summary. Consume its named layers and diagnostics rather than inferring state from an omitted layer.",
		"",
		"| Layer | Truth it supplies |",
		"|-------|-------------------|",
		"| `project-synthesis` | The latest `wrap(project)` synthesis. |",
		"| `scoped-checkpoint` | The latest non-project wrap, only when no project synthesis exists; it is explicitly labeled as a fallback. |",
		"| `active-lineage` | Journal evidence associated with active Change lineage. |",
		"| `unresolved-blockers` | Blocks that do not have a later exact-scope unblock. |",
		"| `deferred-intent` | Open deferred-intent decision and spark pairs. |",
		"| `active-changes` | Git-derived active Change evidence and worktree state. |",
		"| `branch-recency` | Recent entries on the selected branch after entries already surfaced as active truth are removed. |",
		"| `transitional-tasks` | Open task-board records retained for compatibility. |",
		"",
		"Each layer reports `source_available`, `available_count`, `shown_count`, `truncated`, and an exact `expand_command`; paginated layers also return a cursor. `source_available: false` means the source could not be derived and is not an empty result. In particular, an unavailable Change source marks both `active-changes` and `active-lineage` unavailable and emits a diagnostic.",
		"",
		"Use `--branch` to select `branch-recency` scope and bind state cursors. It does not override active Change provenance or reasons, which always use the actual Git branch. Use `--layer` to request one canonical layer. `--limit` accepts 1 through 100 only with `--layer`; `--cursor` also requires `--layer` and cannot expand the intrinsic one-item `project-synthesis` or `scoped-checkpoint` layers. Reuse the returned `expand_command` verbatim: cursors are bound to their layer, project, branch, snapshot, and limit. `--json` is the stable machine surface; human output retains the same counts, unavailable markers, and expansion command.",
