// openRegularFile opens a path for reading and returns the descriptor only when
// the descriptor itself is a regular file.
//
// Both halves carry weight. O_NONBLOCK is what stops a FIFO from holding the
// open until somebody writes to it — the hang that would freeze `loaf install`
// and `loaf upgrade` against a directory nobody has vouched for yet. Settling
// the type on the descriptor rather than on the name is what closes the window
// between the two: a path that stats as a regular file can be swapped for a
// FIFO before the open lands, and the question worth answering is what is being
// read, not what was there a moment earlier. Regular files ignore O_NONBLOCK
// for reads, so a read through this descriptor behaves exactly as it would
// without it.
//
// Every read of a path Loaf did not write goes through here: the detector
// probes that decide whether this is a Loaf repo, and the project-file readers
// that run once they have decided. They ask the same question of the same
// untrusted paths, so they get their answer from one implementation.
