# Query Optimization

Patterns for identifying and resolving database performance issues.

## EXPLAIN ANALYZE Usage

Always analyze before optimizing:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

**Key metrics to examine:**

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Seq Scan | Full table scan (often bad for large tables) |
| Index Scan | Using an index (usually good) |
| Rows | Estimated vs actual row counts |
| Loops | Number of times operation executed |
| Buffers | Memory/disk usage |
| Execution Time | Actual query duration |

**Red flags:**
- `Seq Scan` on large tables with selective WHERE
- Large difference between estimated and actual rows
- High `loops` count in nested operations
- `Sort` operations without index support

## Common Query Anti-Patterns

### Functions on Indexed Columns

```sql
-- Bad: prevents index use
WHERE LOWER(email) = 'test@example.com'

-- Better: functional index or store normalized
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_lower ON users(LOWER(email));
```

### SELECT *

```sql
-- Bad: fetches unnecessary data
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;

-- Better: explicit columns
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

### OR Conditions

```sql
-- Bad: often prevents index use
WHERE status = 'active' OR created_at > '2024-01-01'

-- Better: UNION for separate index scans
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
UNION
SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01';
```

### NOT IN with Subquery

```sql
-- Bad: poor performance with NULLs
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM blocked_users)

-- Better: NOT EXISTS
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM blocked_users WHERE user_id = users.id)
```

## N+1 Query Detection

**Symptom:** Many similar queries in rapid succession.

```
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 2;
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 3;
-- ... repeated N times
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Eager loading** (ORM level)
2. **Batch queries:** `WHERE user_id IN (1, 2, 3, ...)`
3. **JOIN in original query**

**Detection:** Enable query logging, look for repeated patterns.

## Pagination Strategies

### Offset Pagination

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id LIMIT 20 OFFSET 100;
```

- **Pros:** Simple, stateless
- **Cons:** Slow for large offsets (scans all skipped rows)

### Cursor Pagination

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 100 ORDER BY id LIMIT 20;
```

- **Pros:** Consistent performance regardless of page
- **Cons:** Can't jump to arbitrary page, cursor must be unique

**Use cursor pagination** for:
- Infinite scroll
- Large datasets
- Real-time data (rows may be added/removed)

## Connection Pooling

| Setting | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| Pool size | Start with 2x CPU cores, measure and adjust |
| Idle timeout | 10-30 seconds typical |
| Max lifetime | Rotate connections periodically (30 min - 1 hour) |

**Calculate max connections:**
```
max_connections > (pool_size * app_instances) + admin_connections
```

## Query Caching Patterns

### Application-Level Cache

```
Cache Key: query_hash + params_hash
TTL: Based on data staleness tolerance
Invalidation: On write to affected tables
```

### Materialized Views

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_stats AS
SELECT date_trunc('month', created_at), COUNT(*)
FROM orders GROUP BY 1;

-- Refresh strategy
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY monthly_stats;
```

**Use for:** Expensive aggregations, reporting queries, data that tolerates staleness.

## Always / Never

| Always | Never |
|--------|-------|
| Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE before optimizing | Optimize based on intuition alone |
| Fetch only needed columns | SELECT * in production code |
| Use parameterized queries | Concatenate user input into SQL |
| Set statement timeouts | Allow unbounded query execution |
| Monitor slow query logs | Ignore database performance metrics |
| Test with production-scale data | Benchmark on empty tables |
