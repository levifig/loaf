# OpenCode-specific overrides for PM agent
# PM is the primary orchestrator in OpenCode (mode: primary vs subagent default)
# OpenCode uses @ mentions for subagents instead of Task() tools

frontmatter:
  name: PM
  mode: primary
  tools:
    # Remove Task() tools - OpenCode uses @ mentions for subagent delegation
    remove:
      - "Task(*)"
    # Add OpenCode's Task permission (for general background tasks, not subagents)
    add:
      Task: true
