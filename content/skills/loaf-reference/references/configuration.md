# Configuration Maintenance

The guided answer to "is this project's Loaf config current, and what fixes it?"
Work top to bottom; stop when the checks pass.

## Diagnose first

Run `loaf config check --json` and read the structured findings — never scrape the
human-readable output. It validates `.agents/loaf.json` and the installed
Loaf-managed hook config, and flags missing safe defaults, stale installed-target
config, and malformed fields.

## Safe repairs

`loaf config check --fix` creates missing safe defaults and refreshes stale
installed-target hook config. Review what it changed, then re-run
`loaf config check --json` to confirm it passes. `--fix` only touches mechanical,
reversible repairs — it never invents project-owned values.

## Project-owned choices (ask the user)

These are decisions, not defaults. The CLI cannot guess them — ask, then record:

- **GitHub account** — `integrations.github.account`, the login the project's `gh`
  commands must run as. The `github-account` enforcement hook checks it against
  `gh auth status`; a mismatch tells the user to run `gh auth switch`.
- **Issue identity** — `issue.authority` (`local`, `linear`, or `github`) and
  `issue.prefix`. Prefix is the local alias token (`VCAM`) or, when authority is
  `linear`, the Linear team key (`ENG`). `loaf init` and a newly created loaf.json
  record a derived local prefix; `loaf issue identity --prefix` / `--authority`
  is the setter. `--fix` never invents these on an existing file.
- **Tracker / integration election** — `integrations.linear.enabled` and the other `integrations.*` toggles. Linear execution identity is `issue.authority`, not the historical skill-mode toggle. When Linear is active, record the exact server exposed by the harness as `integrations.linear.mcp_server_name`. The Linear or bootstrap skill records this project-owned value; Loaf does not install or authenticate the MCP.
- **Which harnesses to install** — the targets passed to `loaf install --to <target>`
  (or `--to all`).
- **Codex basic command policy** — `loaf install --to codex --codex-basic-commands` explicitly installs PATH `loaf` managed command rules for the centrally classified basic Loaf leaves, including hardened journal logging and approved readers, outside the workspace sandbox. Each rule keeps the subcommand prefix; the policy does not grant a bare `loaf` namespace or a writable Loaf data-directory root. Global `AGENTS.md` remains user-owned: no guidance block is installed or required. Upgrades remove only unchanged recorded legacy blocks in regular files; edited blocks, absent blocks, and symlinks are preserved and never block independent rule updates. Ownership records for preserved legacy guidance are retained, not treated as a requirement to recreate it. Unclassified and operator commands remain gated. Do not enable it implicitly.
- **Codex lifecycle hooks** — Codex `0.144.1` rejects Loaf's legacy flat hook schema. Loaf installs a current-schema `SessionStart` matcher group whose command is PATH `loaf journal context --from-hook --codex-hook`; POSIX installs omit the Windows variant, while Windows installs keep both command fields as that PATH form. Startup is model-visible proven only for the isolated `darwin-arm64` smoke; other lifecycle modes and automatic completion remain gated, and skill/project instructions plus explicit CLI retrieval remain the fallback.

## Hand-edit only where no setter exists

Some fields (for example `integrations.github.account`) have no CLI setter. Edit
`.agents/loaf.json` narrowly for those, leave everything else to the CLI, and
immediately re-validate with `loaf config check --json`. Never hand-edit
Loaf-managed hook files — regenerate them through `loaf build` and `loaf install`.

## Refresh installed targets

`loaf upgrade` updates already-installed targets and applies deprecation-manifest cleanup (removing retired skills and targets). Run it after config or skill changes so installed harnesses match the source. It is safe to run from anywhere: project surfaces are refreshed only inside a detected Loaf repo, and `--to <target>` narrows the sync to one already-installed target. Cursor, OpenCode, Amp, Claude Code, and Codex generated hook commands stay `loaf …` on PATH; scoped `--select` fails closed if that PATH binary is missing or lacks required `loaf check --hook` or standalone `loaf check` commands, and does not publish `{XDG_DATA_HOME}/loaf/pinned/loaf`. Codex basic-command policy upgrades rewrite unmodified managed rules from an absolute pin to PATH `loaf` plus the same classified prefixes, and preserve modified or foreign policy.

`loaf install` is for onboarding — deploying Loaf into a folder that does not have it, or adding a harness that is not installed yet. Inside a Loaf repo it no-ops the project part and points at `loaf upgrade`.

If the Codex Auto-journal rule was previously enabled, upgrade refreshes it only while the installed body still matches Loaf's recorded digest. Unowned or locally modified rule files are preserved and reported as conflicts.

## Confirm project alignment

`loaf doctor` checks symlinks, stale files, and version drift across the checkout without changing anything. `loaf doctor --fix` offers each safe repair separately and defaults each y/N prompt to no; declined repairs remain reported failures. Use `loaf doctor --fix --force` only when every offered repair should be accepted without prompting, including in non-interactive automation. This catches drift that config-level checks do not.

## Record the decisions

Log the project-owned choices you settled with the user:
`loaf journal log "decision(config): ..."`.
