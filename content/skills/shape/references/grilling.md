# Grilling

The interview technique for `[KU]` entries — known unknowns precise enough to phrase as a question. Imported from the reviewed `grill-me` / `grill-with-docs` pattern, sharpened with architectural-impact ordering.

This is a distinct, shape-specific technique — not the shared `templates/grilling.md` used by `refactor-deepen`. That template's glossary-mutation duty doesn't fit shape's ambiguity-resolving step (see the rationale it documents); shape's grilling stays scoped to fog entries and never writes to the domain glossary. Architecture uses targeted clarification and does not import either grilling protocol.

## The Mechanic

Ask one question at a time, with a recommendation, using your harness's structured question tool if it has one (otherwise one inline question per message — same semantics, just without the structured UI). Never batch questions into a form; a form invites the user to skim and accept defaults, which is exactly the quick-capture failure grilling exists to avoid.

Every question carries a recommended answer with rationale — never "what do you think?" alone. The recommendation forces a position; the user is free to override it, but the question isn't complete without one.

## Ordering

Prioritize questions whose answer would change the architecture. Cosmetic questions — naming, ordering, presentation — go last, even when they're easier to answer. An architecture-changing answer received late can invalidate everything decided in between; asking it first avoids that rework.

Before asking, check whether reading resolves the question — an existing ADR, a prior issue, a journal entry. Only ask what reading couldn't answer.

## Stop Condition

Stop when either holds:

- No unrouted `[KU]` entries remain.
- Answers stop changing the issue — the last several questions confirmed direction rather than altering the body, the criteria, or the children.

Write each accepted answer into the issue as it lands: `loaf issue edit` for the body, `loaf issue dod add` for a new done-check, `loaf issue new --kind decision` (ledger; no `--ref`) when the answer is itself a sharp question that still needs a later call. Do not leave a resolved `[KU]` only in the conversation.

## Mid-Interview Reroute

If a question turns out to need domain fluency the shaper doesn't have — the follow-up can't even be phrased — stop grilling it and route the entry to the blindspot pass instead of guessing at an answer.

## Opening

Grilling never opens the session. Context gathering and the blindspot-pass offer come first; an interview without that groundwork asks questions the codebase or journal could have answered for free.
