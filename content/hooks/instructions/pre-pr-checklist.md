## Before creating this PR, complete these steps:

### 1. Shipping unit

Confirm that the branch represents exactly one shippable root. Related stacked children must have verified ancestry and be assembled into the root with `git merge --ff-only`; independent shippable roots need separate PRs unless an explicit human decision records why one atomic landing is safer.

### 2. CHANGELOG entry

Add an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`, categorized by Common Changelog impact:

| Commit type | Category |
|-------------|----------|
| `feat` | Added |
| `fix` | Fixed |
| `refactor`, `perf` | Changed |
| `docs` (user-facing) | Changed |
| `chore`, `ci`, `test` | Skip unless notable |

One line per meaningful change. Write imperative, self-describing,
release-facing prose; include public references when available, and do not
include internal spec/task IDs.

```markdown
### Added

- Add bootstrap guidance for 0-to-1 project setup
```

If `CHANGELOG.md` does not exist, create it first:

```markdown
# Changelog

This project follows [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). `## [Unreleased]`
is a workflow staging section for curated entries that land with PRs before a later release.

### 3. PR title

Conventional commit format, under 70 characters:

```
feat: add thermal rating calculation
fix: prevent divide by zero in sag calculation
```

No scope prefixes. No SPEC/TASK IDs in the title.

### 4. PR body

Build the body from the live canonical tracker record and the observed branch diff. Through the selected `project-management/v1` provider skill and harness-native connection, re-read the native reference, problem, definition of done, exclusions, relationships, and current status. Include the native reference, a concise change summary, criterion-by-criterion evidence, verification actually run, and remaining risk.

Do not render or synchronize a Loaf-local work record. If the tracker connection or a required read capability is unavailable, stop and report the connection-specific gap rather than inventing or reconstructing canonical work state. After creating the PR, read the PR body back and confirm that it matches the live work contract and observed diff.

### 5. Merge strategy

This shippable unit lands later through ship with the project's merge strategy (`git.merge_strategy` in `.agents/loaf.json`, or the git-workflow skill's fallback). Under squash, prepare a clean extended description (2-4 lines summarizing the outcome) and never use the auto-generated squash description. Under merge or rebase, every branch commit lands on the default branch as written, so make each one a clean checkpoint before review. Never create a merge commit merely to preserve feature-branch topology.

Complete these steps, then re-run `gh pr create` with the prepared body.
