  Covers schema design, optimization, and database administration. Includes
  primary key selection (UUID/ULID/serial), safe migrations, query optimization
  with EXPLAIN ANALYZE, indexing strategies (B-tree, partial, composite), and
  normalization tradeoffs. Use when designing tables, writing migrations, or
  when the user asks "what primary key should I use?" or "how do I optimize this
  query?" Not for ORM-level code patterns (use language skill) or infrastructure
  provisioning (use infrastructure-management).

# Database Skill

Domain knowledge for database administration and development. Covers schema design, migrations, query optimization, and indexing strategies.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing new tables or modifying existing schemas
- Writing or reviewing database migrations
- Optimizing slow queries
- Planning index strategies
- Evaluating normalization vs denormalization tradeoffs

## Key Reference Files

| File | Use When |
|------|----------|
| [schema-design.md](references/schema-design.md) | Creating tables, choosing keys, audit patterns |
| [migrations.md](references/migrations.md) | Writing safe, reversible migrations |
| [query-optimization.md](references/query-optimization.md) | Debugging slow queries, N+1 detection |
| [indexing.md](references/indexing.md) | Choosing index types, composite index order |

## Quick Reference

### Primary Key Selection

| Type | Use When | Avoid When |
|------|----------|------------|
| UUID v4 | Distributed systems, no sequential exposure | Need sortability, space-constrained |
| ULID | Need sortability + uniqueness | Legacy system compatibility |
| Serial/Identity | Single database, simple use case | Distributed writes, ID exposure concerns |

### Migration Safety

```
Safe (online):     ADD COLUMN (nullable), ADD INDEX CONCURRENTLY, CREATE TABLE
Unsafe (offline):  ADD COLUMN NOT NULL (without default), DROP COLUMN, RENAME
```

### Index Decision Tree

```
High cardinality + equality lookups  → B-tree (default)
Low cardinality + many values        → Consider partial index
Array/JSON containment               → GIN
Geometric/range queries              → GiST
Exact equality only                  → Hash (rare)
```

## Core Principles

1. **Data integrity first** - Constraints catch bugs that code misses
2. **Plan for scale** - Design decisions are expensive to change
3. **Measure before optimizing** - Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE, not intuition
4. **Backward compatibility** - Migrations must not break running code
