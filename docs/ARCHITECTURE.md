### Build Flow

```
cmd/loaf + internal/cli -> go build -> bin/native/{platform}/loaf
content/ + config/ -> loaf build -> dist/ + plugins/
```

Each target transformer reads content (skills/agents/hooks) and config, then produces target-specific output. Skills get sidecar files merged. Hooks get registered in plugin manifests. Shared templates get distributed to specified skills.

The public runtime and CLI reference generation are native Go. Remaining non-Go files under `cli/` are JavaScript launcher/build/smoke/evaluation scripts, not TypeScript command implementations or tests.

### Native Stateful Runtime (ADR-014)

ADR-014 records the decision to use Go for Loaf's stateful core. Native Go is the shipped public runtime; TypeScript command registrations, the fallback bundle, and the TypeScript test harness are no longer part of the active CLI surface.

The public command has one native runtime:

```
loaf                     # Native Go command surface
└── command families       # Stateful operations, build/install, checks, and project workflows
```

Historical decision records describe how the runtime moved, but the active `cli/` tree contains only JavaScript launcher, build, verification, smoke, and evaluation scripts. It does not contain TypeScript command source or tests.

Skills call `loaf`, hooks enforce through `loaf`, and users see one command surface. ADR and SPEC identifiers cited in this document serve only as decision and work provenance.

### Operational State Identity

Loaf stores operational state in one global SQLite database at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/loaf/loaf.sqlite`, partitioned by project ID. New project IDs are generated and stored in SQLite; they are not derived from checkout path or friendly name. The `projects` row carries the friendly display name and current path, while `project_paths` records path mappings so a checkout can move without changing identity. Legacy path-hash IDs remain only as an adoption key for migrated pre-stable-identity data.

### Recovery Tiers and Restore Safety

Recovery has three named tiers: `local_rollback` snapshots remain in the same data home for local corruption rollback, project-scoped replay is the ordinary rollback mechanism for later migrations, and `external_disaster_copy` is an operator-selected non-temporary external destination for a point-in-time copy. An explicit destination is resolved through symlinks and rejected when it is absolute-but-volatile; the path check does not prove that the destination is physically remote or durable, so `device_loss_protected` remains false. Backup and verification results include SQLite validity, journal retrieval readiness, search parity, project evidence, checksum, and the latest canonical journal watermark.

`loaf state backup restore <backup> --to <absolute-empty-database-path>` is an isolated disposable rehearsal. It creates an exact copy at an empty target, verifies integrity, foreign keys, schema, projects, canonical journal rows, derived search parity, and the watermark, and leaves the live database untouched. There is no automated live activation, no universal mutation lease honored by every writer, and no claim that a concurrent restore is safe.

Live activation is therefore a quiesced operator procedure: stop or terminate every harness, Loaf process, background writer, and process that might retain an open database connection; verify the backup and isolated rehearsal; retain a preserve-current backup; while quiesced move the old main database and any matching `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars together into durable quarantine; install the verified copy with mode `0600`; start current Loaf; run `loaf state doctor`, `loaf state status`, and a known journal retrieval check; and, on failure, quiesce again and activate the preserve-current copy. Sidecars from different database files must never be mixed.

### Targets

| Target | Output | Agents | Skills | Hooks | Runtime Plugin |
|--------|--------|:------:|:------:|:-----:|:--------------:|
| claude-code | plugins/loaf/ | Yes | Yes | Yes | plugin.json |
| cursor | dist/cursor/ | Yes | Yes | Yes | hooks.json |
| opencode | dist/opencode/ | Yes | Yes | Yes | hooks.ts |
| codex | dist/codex/ | No | Yes | Yes | hooks.json |
| amp | dist/amp/ | No | Yes | No | .amp/plugins/loaf.ts |

### Amp Plugin API Constraints

Amp's plugin API is intentionally minimal. Plugin handlers are dispatched via `handleRequest()` for exactly four event names:

- `tool.call` — before a tool is invoked
- `tool.result` — after a tool returns
- `agent.start` — when an agent begins a turn
- `agent.end` — when an agent finishes a turn

There is no session-lifecycle dispatch. Amp's binary internally emits `emitEvent("session.start", ...)` for telemetry purposes, but this is not exposed to plugins. Features that require a SessionStart hook (the journal continuity digest, SOUL.md self-healing) or PreCompact flushes are not viable on Amp without upstream support. Loaf's Amp target is scoped to tool events only; the SessionStart digest that other targets ship is intentionally absent here.

`agent.end` is turn-end, not session-end, so Loaf does not map session lifecycle behavior onto it.

### Prompt Overlay Consolidation (ADR-010)

The managed fenced section is written once to a canonical file (`.agents/AGENTS.md`). Per-harness paths are symlinks to it.

```
.agents/AGENTS.md                         # Canonical (source of truth, committed)
.claude/CLAUDE.md        → symlink →      .agents/AGENTS.md
./AGENTS.md              → symlink →      .agents/AGENTS.md  (agents.md spec)
```

**Write path (`loaf install`):** the native Go installer resolves each target's destination via `realpath` and groups writes by canonical path. Supported targets that share `.agents/AGENTS.md` produce a single canonical write. Before writing, the native project-symlink installer handles each link according to its observed state:

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| nothing at linkPath | Create symlink |
| correct symlink | No-op (silent) |
| wrong symlink | Prompt to relink (auto-yes under `--yes`) |
| regular file | Prompt to merge content into canonical under `## Migrated from <path>`, back up as `.bak`, then symlink |

Fresh installs pre-create an empty canonical shell so symlinks are never dangling. `--yes` flag and non-TTY auto-detection allow the flow to run under CI/skills without interactive prompts.

**Config health (`loaf config check`):** the native CLI validates `.agents/loaf.json` and installed Loaf-managed hook config separately. `--fix` creates missing safe project-config defaults and refreshes stale installed target artifacts through the same target installers as `loaf install`, so new hooks such as `github-account` can be propagated without hand-editing target config files.

**Drift detection (`loaf doctor`):** Checks cover canonical presence, per-harness symlink targets, stale `.cursor/rules/loaf.mdc`, fenced-section version match, duplicate-resolved writes, and target coverage. `loaf doctor --fix` applies safe repairs non-interactively.

This extends the "CLI is the correct protocol layer" principle to filesystem convention enforcement: the CLI owns the on-disk overlay state, not the skills or the user. ADR-010 records the consolidation from per-harness writes to one canonical file.

### Work Records and Optional Linear Tasks (ADR-011)

New bounded work is git-canonical under `docs/changes/YYYYMMDD-slug/change.md`. Existing specs in `.agents/specs/` and task records remain supported compatibility surfaces. For compatible task workflows, `integrations.linear.enabled` in `.agents/loaf.json` selects the execution backend:

- **Local-tasks mode** (default): tasks, journal entries, ideas, sparks, brainstorms, and drafts live in the global SQLite database.
- **Linear-native mode**: existing compatible specs remain git-canonical while tasks use Linear sub-issues under a parent rollup issue.

The split reflects an architectural principle from ADR-010's consolidation pattern extended to the spec/task artifact model:

- **Deliberation artifacts belong with code.** Changes, existing specs, ADRs, and councils need git history, code-adjacent visibility, and independence from tracker availability.
- **Execution artifacts belong in the tracker.** Tasks, blockers, comments, assignees. Need real-time state, dashboards, blocking graphs, notifications.

In Linear-native mode, the parent Linear issue is a **canonical-elsewhere rollup**: a summary and link to the git-canonical artifact, not a re-host. The artifact exists in one place; the tracker is a thin execution surface.

Skills detect the mode and branch accordingly; the same skill content selects a different task backend without changing the git-canonical artifact.

### Pre-Flight Dependency Gate

`/implement`'s Linear-native routing enforces `blockedBy` as a **hard pre-flight gate**: before moving a sub-issue to `in_progress` or starting work, every issue in its `blockedBy` field must be in a `completed`-type state. If not, the skill refuses to start — no work begun, no issue moved.

This is different from advisory dependency ordering: the dependency graph becomes a runtime invariant, not a suggestion. The orchestrator cannot implement through open blockers even by accident.

Local task dependencies are stored in SQLite and remain advisory. Pre-flight gating requires a backend that can reliably query every blocker's current state; Linear provides that guarantee for its task workflow, while local tasks trade strict enforcement for simplicity.

Parent-issue completion follows from the same contract: when the last sub-issue flips to `completed`, `/implement` auto-closes the parent. A parent with any open sub-issue, including `blocked`, stays open.

### Agent Model: Functional Profiles

Loaf uses **functional profiles** defined by tool access boundaries, not role-based agents defined by domain identity. Skills provide all domain knowledge; profiles provide the tool sandbox.

**The Orchestrator:**

The main conversation is the **orchestrator** — the coordinator that plans and delegates but does not directly implement, review, research, or curate durable artifacts.

**Functional Profiles:**

| Profile | Tool Access | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| implementer | Full write | Writes code, tests, config, docs. Speciality via skills at spawn time. |
| reviewer | Read-only | Audits and verifies. Cannot modify what it reviews — independence is structural. |
| researcher | Read + Web | Investigates options, compares approaches, returns structured reports. No write or execute. |
| librarian | Read + Edit (.agents/) | Tends the project journal and durable `.agents/` artifacts, including wrap checkpoints. Does not implement or research. |

Each profile is defined in `content/agents/{implementer,reviewer,researcher,librarian}.md` — a minimal behavioral contract and tool boundary, not domain knowledge. A spawned implementer becomes a backend engineer, DBA, or devops engineer depending entirely on the skills loaded at spawn time.

**System Agent:**

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| background-runner | Async non-blocking tasks (haiku model) |

**Council Composition:**

Councils convene implementers and researchers for deliberation; reviewers join only after, to verify the outcome. The orchestrator runs the council but never votes — the team decides, the orchestrator integrates.

**Skills as Universal Knowledge Layer:**

Skills are the only knowledge mechanism that works across all targets (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Amp). Profiles are Claude Code infrastructure — other targets activate knowledge through skills alone. This makes skills the primary investment surface: better skill descriptions and organization improve all targets simultaneously.

## Operating Principles

Principles that shape how Loaf is designed and operated. Unlike ADRs, these are mutable and evolve via `/reflect` as the project learns. They sit above implementation choices but below VISION (which captures product intent and direction).

### Authorship Model — Agents Create, Humans Curate

Agents are the primary authors of Changes, knowledge files, ADRs, and compatible task records. Humans review, approve, and curate — they are not the writing surface. The CLI follows from this: it is for deterministic operations and health checks, while skills guide authorship and judgment.

The principle inverts the traditional "humans write docs, agents consume them" model. Agents are already doing the work and are closest to what's being learned; pulling knowledge creation into the work itself ("maintenance as side effect of work") is cheaper than treating documentation as a separate sprint. Humans are better at judgment — *is this worth recording?* — than at the writing.

The growth loop is concrete: an agent discovers an insight during exploration, implementation, or debugging, proposes the appropriate durable record, and a human accepts, edits, or rejects it. Hooks prompt agents when insights are fresh so useful learning is not deferred until context is gone.

This principle shapes skill design and CLI surface; it is mutable and evolves via `/reflect`.

### Adversarial Review for Substantive Guidance Changes

Substantive changes to skills, guidance docs, or operating principles warrant review beyond the implementer's own check. The Loaf baseline is `loaf:reviewer` (internal-consistency auditor). When available, an adversarial design stress-tester (`codex:rescue` or equivalent) is highly recommended — the two readers catch different defect classes:

- **Internal-consistency review** (`loaf:reviewer`) surfaces stale references, anchor breaks, prose drift, and contradictions between sections.
- **Adversarial design review** (`codex:rescue`, optional) stress-tests the design itself for false positives, false negatives, and self-contradictions; constructs decision examples the rules don't handle cleanly.

Codex is plugin-dependent — it may not be available in all environments. `loaf:reviewer` is the floor; the adversarial pass is recommended when the change is substantive enough that a design defect would compound across many future invocations (skill rewrites, lifecycle codifications, hook-policy changes).

This principle shapes how Loaf evolves substantive guidance. Evidence: the architecture-skill tightening + ADR deprecations (PR #46) shipped through three review-driven refinement rounds, with each reviewer catching defect classes the other missed.

### Recategorization as a General Lifecycle Pattern

Loaf artifacts evolve in two distinct ways:

- **Supersession** — the underlying answer changed; a new artifact replaces the old. The old is preserved as historical record (`status: Superseded`, `superseded_by:` linkage). Used for ADRs whose decisions changed.
- **Recategorization** — the underlying rule still holds, but the artifact's classification was wrong from the outset. The artifact is deprecated in place (`status: Deprecated`, `migrated_to:` reference in the body), and the rule's active source moves to its appropriate home.

Recategorization emerged from PR #46: three ADRs whose conventions/principles still held had been classified as architectural decisions when they were actually a naming convention, an operating principle, and skill-specific workflow lore. Supersession (write a new ADR replacing each) was the wrong tool — there was nothing to replace, only to relabel. Recategorization preserves the historical record without overstating its current authority.

This pattern generalizes beyond ADRs. When any Loaf artifact is later judged to have been classified wrong but its content is still valid, recategorize: deprecate the original, point to the new canonical home, leave the body intact for archeology.

## Change-First Execution Model

New bounded work uses a Change as its primary contract. The project journal remains the execution trace and resumption protocol; tasks are optional durable records rather than mandatory decomposition.

```
/idea or /brainstorm → /shape → Change → /implement → review → /ship
                                      ↓
                               project journal
```

### Work Records

```
docs/changes/YYYYMMDD-slug/change.md  # Primary bounded-work contract
SQLite tasks                          # Existing or optional compatible work items
.agents/specs/SPEC-XXX.md              # Existing compatible bounded-work records
SQLite journal_entries                # Project-scoped event record across conversations
```

**Changes** define the problem, hypothesis, scope, implementation units, verification contract, and definition of done. `loaf change check` validates their structure and derives executability.

**Tasks and specs** remain supported compatibility records. They may describe individual concerns, dependencies, and existing bounded work, but new shaping does not require a spec or a task decomposition layer.

**The journal** captures *what happened* — `journal_entries` rows are project-scoped events (`project_id NOT NULL`), each tagged with an opaque `harness_session_id` that correlates one conversation's entries. Decisions, discoveries, commits, and progress land as structured entries; `loaf journal recent`/`show`/`search` and the `loaf journal context` digest provide handoff-ready context for compaction recovery and cross-conversation resumption. There is no session entity — see [Session Model: Journal-First](#session-model-journal-first).

`.agents/tasks/`, `.agents/ideas/`, `.agents/sparks/`, `.agents/brainstorms/`, `.agents/drafts/`, and `.agents/TASKS.json` are rollback material after the SQLite cutover recorded by `SPEC-045`, not compatibility mirrors. A stale branch that reintroduces them should keep the deletion side and rerun `loaf check --hook ephemeral-provenance`. Legacy `.agents/sessions/` Markdown is also gone: the journal is SQLite-native and never rendered to a hand-authored source file.

### Session Model: Journal-First

The project journal is the **only** session-related structure. There is no session entity — no `sessions` table, no statuses, no lifecycle, no rotation. `journal_entries` are project-scoped events (`project_id NOT NULL`) in the global SQLite database, each carrying an opaque `harness_session_id` column that correlates the entries written by one conversation. Nobody opens, closes, or transitions a session; nothing is ever "unwrapped."

The journal model supersedes the former mutable session lifecycle. **Concurrent conversations on the same project — across branches, worktrees, even harnesses — are safe by construction:** simultaneous writers interleave rows with different `harness_session_id` tags instead of rotating or reconciling shared session state.

**Logging:** `loaf journal log "type(scope): description"` appends a durable entry; the current branch and harness id are attached automatically. Skills self-log their invocation as their first action; the `session` entry type is gone.

**Wrap is an optional checkpoint, not a transition.** A `wrap` entry is written only when a conversation holds synthesis worth saving — "tried X, abandoned because Y, next is Z" — the connective narrative that evaporates with the context window. Everything else is derivable from raw entries. A conversation that ends abruptly leaves a perfectly valid journal. A wrap claims the writing conversation's own entries (its `harness_session_id`); a manual/untagged wrap falls back to branch scope.

**Continuity is derived, layered, and ephemeral.** At conversation start the SessionStart hook runs `loaf journal context --from-hook`, which emits a digest computed at read time: the latest project-level `wrap` + recent entries scoped to the current branch/worktree + open (`in_progress`/`pending`) tasks. The digest is shown, then discarded — never persisted, because auto-persisting arrival syntheses would re-pollute the journal with derived noise.

**Subagent detection:** Hook JSON from Claude Code includes `agent_id` only for subagents. `loaf journal context --from-hook` checks for this and exits silently, writing nothing — subagents get no digest and create no entries, preventing churn when the Task tool spawns them.

**Compaction resilience:** The journal is external memory that survives context compaction. PreCompact nudges a flush of unrecorded decisions and next actions. PostCompact re-emits the continuity digest. No separate snapshot mechanism, and no Stop/SessionEnd obligation — the SessionEnd hook was removed entirely.

### Journal Entry Sources

The journal receives entries from multiple layered sources:

| Source | Mechanism | When |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Skills | `loaf journal log` in skill Critical Rules | Self-logging on invocation |
| Git events | PostToolUse command hooks (`loaf journal log --from-hook`) | Commits, PRs, merges (automatic) |
| Task events | TaskCompleted hook (`loaf journal log --from-hook`) | Task completed/cancelled (automatic) |
| Compaction | PreCompact command hook | Journal flush nudge before compaction |
| Wrap | `loaf journal log "wrap(scope): …"` | Voluntary end-of-conversation synthesis |

Skills self-log as their first action. Git and task events are captured automatically by hooks. Continuity is read, not written: the SessionStart and PostCompact hooks emit the derived digest rather than logging entries.

**Continuation policy:**

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Same scope, continuing work | Compact (journal survives) |
| Different scope entirely | New conversation (journal persists project-wide) |
| Finished and archived a spec | New conversation |
| Context full mid-task | Auto-compact |
| Quick unrelated question | New conversation |

A new conversation is never a new "session" — it is just a new `harness_session_id` writing into the same project journal. Whether to wrap before switching is a judgment call about whether synthesis is worth saving, not a lifecycle requirement.

### Forward-Only In-Flight Pivots

When review reveals that code on an open branch should not ship as designed, the project favors **forward removal commits over history rewriting**. The final squash preserves a clean mainline diff, while the pull request retains review context and an honest record of the pivot. Avoid force-pushing away citations or shared review history.

## Hook Architecture

Hooks are defined in `config/hooks.yaml` and distributed to target-specific formats at build time. For Claude Code, the canonical hook registration file is `hooks/hooks.json` (inside the plugin output directory). `plugin.json` silently drops non-matcher session events (SessionStart, PreCompact, PostCompact, TaskCompleted) — all hooks should be registered in `hooks.json`.

### Dispatch Types

| Type | Field | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| script | `script:` | Runs a shell script |
| command | `command:` | Runs a CLI command (e.g., `loaf check --hook <id>`) |
| prompt | `prompt:` | Injects text directly to the AI model |

### Hook Type Behavioral Constraints

The target hook APIs impose these behavioral constraints:

- **`type: prompt`** — Binary gate. Any non-empty LLM response is treated as rejection (`ok: false`). Cannot express "this looks fine, proceed" — the response itself blocks. Unusable for advisory hooks or hooks requiring LLM judgment. Use only for validation that returns empty on success.
- **`type: agent`** — Read-only tool access (Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch). No Edit, Write, or Bash. Max 50 turns. Useful for observation, not mutation.
- **`type: command`** — Correct primitive for context injection and side effects. Exit 0 with stdout for context injection. Exit 1 for non-blocking warning. Exit 2 to block the action.
- **Stop-event circularity (general caution)** — A hook that mutates state the hook chain itself monitors can re-trigger that chain. Any hook write must be idempotent or guarded against re-entry. Journal-first removes the specific hazard (there is no Stop/SessionEnd hook writing back to a session record), but the constraint still governs any future stateful hook.
- **PreCompact prompt hooks** — Not supported outside REPL sessions. Use `type: command` for PreCompact context injection.
- **`plugin.json` drops non-matcher events** — Session events (SessionStart, PreCompact, PostCompact, TaskCompleted) must be registered in `hooks/hooks.json`, not `plugin.json`.
- **UserPromptSubmit has no matcher** — Fires on every user message, cannot be filtered by tool name or input.
- **Session events use different JSON shape** — `hook_event_name` field instead of `tool_name`. TaskCompleted passes `task_subject` and `task_description`.
- **Plugin caching** — Cached plugin versions serve stale hook handlers during development. Marketplace remove/re-add is the reliable cache-busting path.
- **CLI-spawned agents need hook isolation** — When the CLI spawns `claude --agent <name> -p`, the child process triggers the SessionStart hook. Set an isolation env var in the child so Loaf's SessionStart digest does not fire in the subprocess. Do NOT use `--bare` — it breaks OAuth for subscription users.
- **`--bare` skips OAuth** — `--bare` mode requires API key auth (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Subscription users on OAuth cannot use `--bare`. Use env var isolation instead.

### Hook Categories

**Enforcement hooks** — quality gates that block bad actions. Run by `loaf check` through the native Go backend. Exit non-zero to block. `failClosed: true` means failures block the action. `github-account` converges the active GitHub CLI account on `.agents/loaf.json` before `gh` commands run — switching accounts when they differ (passing with a warning so the mutation is visible) and blocking only when the switch cannot be performed; `validate-push` restricts direct pushes to the default branch to `.agents/` and `docs/` files only. Code changes require a feature branch and pull request.

**Instruction hooks** — context injection at tool invocation. Triggered by `matcher` patterns (tool name) and optionally filtered by `if` conditions (tool input). Inject relevant skill instructions or nudges.

**Session event hooks** — tied to events (`SessionStart`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `TaskCompleted`). SessionStart emits the journal continuity digest (`loaf journal context --from-hook`); PreCompact nudges a journal flush; PostCompact re-emits the digest; TaskCompleted auto-logs completions. There is no SessionEnd or Stop journal obligation.

### Hook JSON Data Model

Claude Code passes JSON to hooks via stdin. Key fields for post-tool hooks:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `session_id` | Current Claude conversation ID |
| `agent_id` | Present only for subagents — the discriminator for session-aware hooks |
| `tool_name` | Name of the tool invoked (e.g., `"Bash"`) |
| `tool_input` | Arguments sent to the tool |
| `tool_response` | Result/output returned by the tool (post-tool only) |
| `cwd` | Working directory |

`loaf journal log --from-hook` uses `tool_input.command` to detect commit/PR/merge patterns and `tool_response` to extract PR numbers from output.

## Knowledge Management

```
docs/knowledge/          # Knowledge files with frontmatter (covers:, topics:, etc.)
docs/decisions/          # ADRs (immutable decision records)
.agents/loaf.json        # Project config (local KB dirs, imports, integration toggles)
```

Knowledge files are managed by `loaf kb` — staleness detection compares file modification time against configurable thresholds. SessionStart surfaces stale file counts. The `/housekeeping` skill flags stale files for review.

## Config

```
.agents/loaf.json               # Project-level (knowledge dirs, integration toggles, settings)
~/.local/share/loaf/            # User-level operational data, including SQLite state
~/.config/loaf/                 # User preferences
```

Integration toggles in `loaf.json` gate runtime features (Linear magic-word detection, MCP recommendations) without rebuilding.

## Test Fixture Hygiene

Any test that spawns a CLI subprocess must use OS-tmp isolation for its fixtures:

```go
workingDir := realpath(t, t.TempDir())
```

CWD-relative fixtures are forbidden for subprocess tests because workers may share filesystem state and cwd. A fixture such as `join(process.cwd(), ".test-...")` can race with another subprocess test even when each file passes independently.

`realpath` is required on macOS because the system tmpdir (`/var/folders/...`) is reached through a `/private/var/folders/...` symlink; without realpath, subprocess cwd comparisons can fail.

The active test harness is now Go. `npm test` delegates to `go test ./...`, and `npm run typecheck` compiles all Go packages with `go test ./... -run=^$`.

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

Patterns that apply across multiple subsystems and emerged from specific post-release followups. Captured here so they inform future work rather than being re-discovered.

### Single-Source Runtime Versioning

The native CLI version must report the package version consistently through the launcher, native runtime, generated targets, and install markers. Go runtime paths read package metadata directly; the obsolete TypeScript version helper was removed after the install and version surfaces moved to native Go.

Any value that must be identical across runtime modes should be injected at build time, not independently resolved by multiple runtime paths. Divergent version discovery creates false positives in every downstream comparison.

### Generated Runtime Plugin Artifacts Parsed From Emitted Output

Files the build emits for downstream runtimes to execute — OpenCode `hooks.ts`, Amp `loaf.js`, and any future per-target runtime plugin — must have tests against the **actual emitted file**, not just the generator's input string.

Source-template assertions cannot prove that escaping remains valid after generation. Native build tests in `internal/cli/build_test.go` therefore read the emitted OpenCode and Amp plugin files and assert the runtime hook bodies and command payloads that downstream runtimes load.

### Visible-Degraded Fallback with Stderr WARN

When strict invariant enforcement would break existing callers but silent fallback risks incorrect behavior, emit a stderr warning that names the missing signal and any silencing flag. The action may proceed for compatibility, but the degraded path must remain visible and regression-testable. The journal no longer uses a branch-fallback session router; entries attach project, branch, and harness context without resolving a mutable session entity.
