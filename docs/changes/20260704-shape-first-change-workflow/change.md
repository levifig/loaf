# Shape-First Hybrid Change Model

## Problem

Loaf's numbered spec/task lifecycle has become heavier than the work it organizes:

- Sequential IDs (`SPEC-NNN`, `TASK-NNN`) require allocation machinery and created the cross-worktree collision class that forced SQLite centralization in the first place.
- Status lifecycles (SPEC-049 vocabulary) demand coherence between SQLite, rendered markdown, and Linear — the render-drift gates exist only to police a dual record.
- Task entities duplicate judgment: the agent that decomposes the work is the agent that implements it.
- "Done" is an asserted flag, never derived evidence.
- Collaborative shaping has no natural review surface; specs are reviewed bespoke rather than PR-native.
- The session entity was removed (SPEC-056) for exactly these reasons. The spec/task layer is the same disease one layer up.

Meanwhile the shipped product is still spec-first: README and the shape skill describe `/shape → SPEC`, and no `loaf change` CLI surface exists yet.

## Hypothesis

A shape-first hybrid model makes each store own what its nature demands:

- **Git owns branch-local work truth**: Change documents, plans, implementation units, PR shaping, commits, and review.
- **SQLite owns cross-work process truth**: sparks, ideas, brainstorms, journal continuity, source provenance, reports, knowledge routing, and publish mappings.
- **External trackers receive projections** of Changes — never a mirrored task/status system.

The user-facing verb is `shape`: turn messy input — a journal entry, spark, idea, brainstorm, Linear issue, review finding, PR conversation, or plain conversation — into a bounded Change. A Change is temporary, reviewable work context. Durable artifacts (specs, ADRs, knowledge docs, schemas, changesets, release notes) are written **after** the work proves what is now true: a final spec describes reality, not a plan.

If this holds, Loaf keeps its differentiators (intake, journal continuity, enforced gates) while shedding the dual-record coherence tax — ending stronger than both its current model and compound-engineering's pure-git model.

## Background

- The project journal is the durable continuity layer; session entities were removed (SPEC-056) because lifecycle state cost more than it returned.
- `docs/changes/20260704-worktree-storage-bootstrap/` already piloted the branch-local Change artifact successfully.
- The `ce-loaf-analysis` session compared Loaf with compound-engineering and ran four Opus-class audits; its executive report recommended this hybrid model, found Loaf already mid-pivot post-SPEC-056, and identified verification contracts plus gates-derived done as Loaf's strongest differentiator.
- CE usefully collapses brainstorm/requirements/plan/units into one artifact moving by document **completeness**, not progress status. Loaf keeps that distinction but relocates the signal into PR state and document structure — no field at all — while rejecting CE's lack of intake, continuity, and enforcement.
- Skills are the portable knowledge layer but are weak at invariants; the CLI is better at deterministic, repeatable operations.
- Prior audits found unused lifecycle verbs rot. New machinery exists only where an actual ceremony exercises it: **if a command or state cannot name the ceremony that uses it, do not build it yet.**
- Older `CR-*`/`CR-000` notes are historical; this direction supersedes numeric CR IDs with slug/dated change folders.

## Scope

**In**

- The Change artifact contract: one `change.md` per `docs/changes/YYYYMMDD-slug/`, growing toward executability.
- A change template extracted from this pilot, plus the Change-aware PR template as distributable content (the PR is the shaping surface, so its template is part of the contract; Loaf's `.github/` copy is the installed instance).
- A deliberately small `loaf change` CLI: `init` and `check` (carrying the structural gate). `archive` waits until a completed Change gives it a ceremony.
- This pilot itself — shaped, branched, and reviewed through the model.

**Out** (deferred to follow-up Changes — see Follow-ups)

- The shape skill rewrite (absorbing breakdown) — its own Change.
- The conversion pass and guidance sweep — their own Change; conversion strictly before sweep so no in-flight work is stranded.
- The broad skill-surface tightening — its own Change, the model's second dogfood.
- The spike harness and the general Verification Contract format (SPEC-017 binary-R revival) — after this pilot proves V1/V2.
- Linear publish mechanics beyond the model definition (SPEC-039 direction).
- Changesets integration build-out (no `.changeset/` exists yet; release guidance reconciliation pending).

**Cut** (explicitly rejected)

- Numeric CR IDs (`CR-000`) — superseded by slug/date folders.
- A persistent task entity for implementation units.
- Bidirectional tracker sync.
- A Change lifecycle state machine.

## Observable Workflow

```text
SQLite journal / sparks / ideas / brainstorms / Linear / current conversation
        |
        v
/shape   (gather context, interview, compare alternatives, bound scope,
        |  critique gate, choose smallest useful artifact)
        v
docs/changes/YYYYMMDD-slug/
  change.md        canonical Change artifact, grows toward executability
  handoff.md       in-flight baton for the next agent/session — deleted at ship (D18)
  notes.md         optional working notes, only when useful
  research/        write-once evidence: spikes, explorations, HTML explainers (D18/D20)
  reviews/         optional packets that must outlive the PR (D15)
        |
        v
draft PR (offered at shaping — opt-in, D21a)  →  spike  →  implementation  →  review  →  merge
        |
        v
durable docs:                          post-merge housekeeping:
  docs/specs/<feature>/...               change folder →
  docs/decisions/ADR-...                 docs/changes/archive/YYYYMMDD-slug/
  docs/knowledge/...
  docs/schema/...
  .changeset/...
```

`shape` means: gather context, interview the user, compare alternatives, define boundaries, identify risks, produce a Product Contract, and optionally mature it into an implementation-ready Change. The value is shaping ambiguous input, not artifact creation — `change create` is not the product, and source-specific input modes (`from idea`, `from journal`, `from Linear`) are conversational, not CLI surface.

### Readiness (derived, never declared)

Readiness distinguishes **document completeness from implementation progress** — but it is not a field. It is read from two places that cannot drift:

- **The PR state.** A draft PR *is* shaping — drafting inherently means the Change is still being formed. Marking the PR ready for review *is* the implementation-ready declaration.
- **Document structure.** `loaf change check` derives executability from the required sections themselves: a Change is implementation-ready when its planning contract, implementation units, verification contract, and definition of done are present and non-empty.

There is no `readiness:` frontmatter to update, police, or let go stale — and no field for progress words to creep into. `loaf change check` treats any status-like frontmatter (`readiness`, `status`, `state`) as a violation (see Verification Contract, V1). Progress remains derived from Git, PR review, and gates.

## Decisions

Provenance: decisions 1–8 accepted in the 2026-07-05 interactive interview against the `ce-loaf-analysis` executive report; 9–10 accepted in follow-up review the same day; 11 accepted after external (Codex) review; 12 accepted from user direction during dogfooding; 13–14 accepted after a worked-examples comparison in the same review cycle; 15–16 accepted 2026-07-06 in the review-layering discussion; 17–20 accepted 2026-07-06 after synthesis of the external inputs (SDD Blueprint, HTML-artifact practice) and the harvest/package design discussion; 21 accepted 2026-07-06 after the three-lens adversarial review of mattpocock/skills; 22 accepted 2026-07-06 in the operating-model discussion (Kanban as derived views, tracker integration, team flow).

1. **One `change.md`, canonical, dogfooded now.** This document is the pilot of its own contract. `notes.md` and `reviews/` remain optional escape hatches.
2. **Archive over delete.** Post-merge housekeeping moves completed change folders to `docs/changes/archive/`. Rationale: squash merges collapse branch history — deleting the folder pre-merge means the change doc never lands on main; deleting post-merge strands it in commit archaeology. Archive keeps it retrievable; the temporary-vs-durable line holds because durable knowledge still lands in specs/ADRs/knowledge.
3. **Draft PR opens at shaping, by default.** Shaping that produces a Change pushes the branch and opens a draft PR (configurable/suggested, solo opt-out). `gh pr list` becomes the in-flight change index — the replacement for `loaf spec list` and the answer to cross-branch visibility.
4. **Coexistence by conversion.** Genuinely in-flight specs convert to Changes by hand (inventory pass required; SPEC-055 and its queued tasks are the first candidate); everything else freezes to archive. `loaf spec`/`loaf task` surfaces are removed only after conversion completes — no stranded work.
5. **Breakdown folds into shape.** Implementation-unit decomposition is a shaping step toward `implementation-ready`. The breakdown skill retires in the guidance sweep.
6. **CLI namespace is `loaf change`.** The CLI is noun-oriented (`loaf journal`, `loaf kb`); skills are verbs (`/shape`). The split already exists in Loaf's product grammar.
7. **The first gate ships with the pilot.** `loaf change check` rejects progress words in `readiness` — this change's own Verification Contract criterion V1. Gates-derived done is proven inside the pilot, not deferred (SPEC-056's convergence-test pattern, applied at birth).
8. **Skill-surface tightening is a related change.** The audit (every skill useful, trim unnecessary instructions, kill shadow/never-used skills, no silent failures) is shaped as its own change once this template settles.
9. **Change indexing follows the `docs_index` pattern, never `artifact_bodies`.** `change.md` is git-canonical; SQLite may hold a derived index (à la `docs_index`/`docs_search`, migration 0008) but never a body copy. This forecloses recreating the body/render drift class this model exists to eliminate. Consequently, SQLite-canonical `loaf plan` prose is retired for change-local work: the plan is a section of `change.md`.
10. **Changes cite journal entries by ID.** Journal entries are append-only with stable IDs; citations cannot go stale. The same rule extends to SQLite-backed reports: cite the report identity, not its render path.
11. **Scope trimmed to core.** This Change ships the artifact contract, the template, and `loaf change init/check` with the pilot gate. The shape-skill rewrite, conversion pass, guidance sweep, skill tightening, and spike harness are follow-up Changes (see Follow-ups) — a smaller reviewable pilot, and more Changes shaped through the model.
12. **The readiness field is dropped; readiness is derived.** Drafting a PR inherently means shaping — the draft→ready flip is the human implementation-ready declaration, and `loaf change check` derives structural executability from the required sections. This supersedes the *mechanism* in Decision 7 and the original readiness vocabulary while keeping their intent: the pilot gate now bans status-like frontmatter outright and computes completeness instead of policing a declared value. Decision 3 (draft PR at shaping) carries the signal.
13. **Section contract: flat product, contained planning, fixed tail.** The Product Contract is the flat opening narrative (Problem, Hypothesis, Scope, Observable Workflow, Rabbit Holes and No-Gos, optional Success Metrics); the Planning Contract is one container section holding the HOW as free-form `###` subsections named by the work; Implementation Units, Verification Contract, and Definition of Done are fixed-name tail sections. `check` needs only the product set, the container, and three tail names — subsection naming inside the container stays free.
14. **`loaf change check` is two-tier with an opt-in gate.** Violations always fail: status-like frontmatter, malformed `YYYYMMDD-slug` naming, identity mismatch (`change:` vs folder slug, `created:` vs folder date), missing Product Contract sections. Executability is derived and reported, never failed by default — a shaping-stage Change is valid. `--require-executable` turns the report into a gate, for CI on non-draft PRs and implement preflight. Output follows the `loaf check` findings shape; required-section lists are hardcoded until a real ceremony demands configurability.
15. **Review layering: conversation iterates, the PR reviews, the journal remembers.** Early shaping churn happens conversationally, with decisions captured to the journal — anchored comments on a still-churning document only orphan. PR review threads are the medium for stability-point review: contract review at the draft→ready flip, implementation review after it. External review rounds conducted off-PR land one round-summary comment on the PR (findings and dispositions), keeping the PR the durable review record. The `reviews/` folder is reserved for packets that must outlive the PR. This sharpens Decision 3: during draft, the PR is visibility; the flip is the moment review relocates to it.
16. **Vocabulary: the artifact is a Change.** "Spec" names the durable post-implementation behavior contract under `docs/specs/` (what is now true, never a plan); "CR" is retired vocabulary, permitted only as historical reference. Already implied by the Cut list, Decision 6, and Durable Outputs — pinned here because naming drift surfaced in use.
17. **The package carries deferrals; ship harvests them.** Deferred work and spun-out follow-ups are written into the Change (Follow-ups / Out) and nowhere else during flight — one write surface, and intake becomes review-gated: a reviewer can challenge a deferral before it enters the queue. At ship, the harvest step captures each item into SQLite intake as a spark citing the change slug; when a tracker is explicitly configured, harvest additionally projects items to it, recorded in the publish ledger. Two-lane rule: work that would still matter if this Change were abandoned goes straight to `loaf spark capture` at discovery — only change-adjacent deferrals ride the package. Tracker election is explicit configuration (`project_tracker:` / `integrations.*`), never tool presence — an authed `gh` does not make GitHub the tracker.
18. **Package structure: the Change folder is the branch-local working directory.** Alongside `change.md`: `handoff.md` — the baton for the next agent or session, ephemeral by rule and deleted at ship (a merged Change has no in-flight state); `notes.md` — scratchpad, as before; `research/` — write-once evidence (spike findings, explorations, architectural explainers), dispositioned at finalize: durable pieces promote to `docs/knowledge/` or specs, the rest archives with the folder; `reviews/` — unchanged (Decision 15). The change template gains the optional-members note with the U3 slice (avoiding a rebuild on the known-stale local CLI).
19. **Finalize merges deltas into the durable spec corpus.** A Change is a delta against `docs/specs/` — added, modified, or removed behavior. Ship's finalize step merges that delta into the durable specs; post-merge housekeeping archives the folder. The archive is the chronological reasoning log; the spec corpus stays current. This gives Durable Outputs its mechanic and retroactively strengthens Decision 2 — the archive is half of a cycle, not a storage preference. (Independently converged with the delta-spec model in the SDD Blueprint synthesis; see Source Inputs.)
20. **Format split: contracts in markdown, evidence in HTML.** `change.md` and everything `loaf change check` reads stay markdown — diffable, checkable, line-reviewable. Rich evidence — explorations, decision aids, architectural explainers ("read architectural changes first, then code") — lives in `research/` as HTML, read rendered and never diffed. An implementation PR should carry or generate an architectural walkthrough as a review aid at Decision 15's stability point.
21. **External-review amendments** (three-lens adversarial review of github.com/mattpocock/skills — the first deliberately disconfirming input; raw reports in `research/mattpocock-review/`):
    - **(a) The draft PR becomes opt-in** *(amends 3)*. Shaping offers the draft PR; nothing opens automatically. A conditional default was rejected as hidden judgment — who evaluates the condition? When no PR exists, document structure (V2) carries readiness; opening a PR ready-for-review is itself the implementation-ready declaration (refines 12's phrasing, not its substance). `loaf change list` grows into the local index.
    - **(b) Harvest mechanics defer to their ceremony** *(amends 17)*. The two-lane rule and harvest intent stand; the publish ledger, tracker projection, and parse mechanics move to the sweep follow-up that owns ship — by this document's own name-the-ceremony rule.
    - **(c) Harvest gains rejections** *(extends 17)*. A Change's Cut list and reasoned won'ts harvest into a deduplicated rejection KB, distinct from deferrals — temporary circumstances make deferrals, not rejections; forgetting a rejection costs a full re-litigation.
    - **(d) Durable-output timing splits by artifact type** *(amends 19)*. Decision records defer to finalize; the living domain glossary may be created or updated inline during a Change — a glossary is consumed by the work that writes it.
    - **(e) Evidence format corrected** *(amends 20)*. Rich/visual evidence → HTML; citation/fact findings → markdown. Committed `research/` holds keep-worthy evidence; purely regenerable review aids may stay uncommitted. Not all evidence is HTML; not all HTML is committed.
    - **(f) V2 is the flagship gate** *(reframes 7)*. The derived- executability report is what proves gates-derived done; the status-frontmatter ban remains as regression insurance — agents add status fields by pattern-matching, and the reviewed repo's own convention drift (a shadow skill invisible to its own router) is evidence that discipline without enforcement decays.
    - **(g) Beyond-one-context escape hatch** *(amends 5 and 13)*. When a Change exceeds one context window or PR, implementation units graduate into claimable tracked units indexed by `change.md` — the map is an index, never a store (independently validating 9 and 10). Owned by a new follow-up; the "smart zone" context budget is the trigger concept.
    - **(h) Archive stands, under review** *(amends 2)*. Post-finalize folders are residue by construction; archive's long-term usefulness is re-evaluated after several Changes complete, with delete-post-finalize (the finalize merge commit is the retrievable archive) as the recorded fallback.
    Meta-finding accepted: prior Source Inputs were uniformly confirming — survivorship bias acknowledged; deliberately adversarial input is now standing practice for shaping rounds.
22. **The operating model: states are derived, projections are caches, authority is partitioned and transferable.**
    - A Change merges only if it changes what is true on main — code or durable docs. Context-only changes are abandoned or converted, never merged.
    - Big refactors are lineages: chains of Changes, serial by default, each citing its parent and harvesting successors. No program entity, no shared change state.
    - WIP discipline: one Change in implementation per surface area; parallel shaping is unconstrained.
    - The canonical change-state vocabulary — `backlog · shaping · todo · in-progress · review · merged` — is the output of derivation (`loaf change state`), never a stored field. "Todo", not "ready", which reads too close to done. `released` is deliberately not a change state: releases are project-level events, and a change's released-ness is derived by joining its merge commit against the release layer.
    - Trackers and any future board UI are caches of the derivation, refreshed at transition events and healed by reconcile. Staleness in a cache is lag, not a lie. Tracker-side vocabulary is "status"; the mapping binds canonical states to tracker status IDs (never names), discovered from the tracker at setup and re-validated periodically — mappings go stale too when a team renames its lanes.
    - Authority is partitioned along the intent/execution seam: before work exists, the configured tracker owns intent (backlog, priority, cancellation — Loaf reads); once a branch or PR exists, derivation owns state (Loaf writes; inbound drags are signals surfaced in triage, never silent mutations). Authority is transferable: work starts local and may adopt a tracker later, with projection bootstrapping cards for existing Changes; the reverse simply leaves cards behind as cold cache. No fact ever has two writers.
    - Local-first parity: every flow — intake, triage, the board, the pick-up queue — is fully defined with no tracker configured; integrations add surfaces, never capabilities.
    - Decomposition stays in-doc and agent-owned: the Change holds intent and strategy; atomic tasks are the implementing agent's business. When team coordination needs claimable units, they live in the tracker's native mechanics — issue task lists, sub-issues, assignment — indexed by `change.md`; Loaf never grows a task entity. (Refines 21g.)
    - Transition events, not ceremony: the system observes work happening (init, the ready flip, merge, tag) and updates projections. The requirements are visibility, deterministic tracking, auditability, and reviewability.

## Rabbit Holes and No-Gos

**No-Gos**

- No Change lifecycle state machine.
- No IDs — no `CR-000`, no numbered `SPEC-*` for this direction.
- No new task entity for implementation units.
- No tracker required for local operation; no default task-level sync; no bidirectional status sync in v1.
- ADRs are not a planning prerequisite.
- The initial CLI sketch is not final product surface.

**Rabbit holes to avoid**

- Any status-like field creeping back onto the Change — V1 bans the field class outright; completeness lives in document structure and PR state.
- SQLite change indexing drifting into body storage — pinned shut by Decision 9.
- Spike overbuild — the spike's stop condition is "enough unknowns discovered to revise the Change," never "it works." The discard default is the guarantee.
- Source-specific CLI commands before dogfooding proves them common, deterministic, and worth promoting.
- The guidance sweep landing before the conversion pass — stranding in-flight spec work in a model whose documentation no longer exists (Decision 4 orders them; both live in a follow-up Change).

## Planning Contract

### Section contract

- **Product Contract** — the flat opening sections: Problem, Hypothesis, Scope, Observable Workflow, Rabbit Holes and No-Gos, plus Success Metrics when validation matters. Product truth reads as narrative; no container.
- **Planning Contract** — this container section, holding the HOW as free-form `###` subsections named by the work (approach, placement, boundaries, risks, sequencing, spike findings). The container is the contract; its subsection names are not.
- **Executable tail** — Implementation Units, Verification Contract, and Definition of Done, followed by Durable Outputs. `check` derives executability from the container and the tail, so those names are fixed.
- **Decisions** — a cross-cutting provenance log serving both contracts.

### Artifact placement

- **Why `docs/changes/` and not `.agents/changes/`:** ADR-013 deliberately routes `.agents/` to the main worktree; Changes are deliberately **branch content** and must live where branch context lives. This is the one point where the new model intersects that rule, and this placement is the deliberate resolution, not an accident.
- Branch names use the human slug only; the folder carries the date:

```text
branch: shape-first-change-workflow
folder: docs/changes/20260704-shape-first-change-workflow/
```

- A small Change maps to one branch and one PR. A larger Change may span multiple PRs; the Change remains the shared context and acceptance contract, each PR the reviewable implementation slice.

### Skill / CLI boundary

The shape skill owns judgment: collecting context from conversation, journal, ideas, brainstorms, reports, or Linear; interviewing for ambiguity, constraints, hidden complexity, and non-goals; running the critique gate; choosing the smallest useful artifact (none, Product Contract only, implementation-ready Change, or a post-implementation durable-spec proposal); teaching the harness when to call the CLI and how to read its output; preserving the line between interactive shaping and autonomous execution.

The CLI owns invariants: validated `YYYYMMDD-slug` folder init; required-file and heading checks; the status-like frontmatter ban; branch/change mismatch detection; listing branch-local Changes; archival moves; machine-readable check output; verification-gate wiring; generated references; materializing the PR template into a consumer repo's `.github/` when absent. CLI help must remain legible to humans, not just agents.

Initial surface, deliberately small:

```bash
loaf change init <slug>
loaf change check
```

`archive` joins this surface when the first completed Change gives post-merge housekeeping its ceremony (Decision 2) — a command that cannot yet name its ceremony is not built yet.

### Linear working model

Linear represents the Change, not implementation units:

```text
Project or Initiative: product or implementation family
  Issue: Change: loaf/shape-first-change-workflow
    Sub-issues: only when parallel ownership or team coordination requires
```

Default federation: one Change → one issue, body published as a snapshot, resulting URL recorded in the publish ledger (`backend_mappings`). No bidirectional status sync, no sub-issue generation, until dogfooding proves the need.

Ceremonies are the federation points: trackers never participate in iteration, only receive projections at ceremony boundaries — the Change published at shaping or ship, deferred items projected at harvest (Decision 17). Election is explicit configuration, never tool presence; with nothing configured, the same ceremonies write only to git and SQLite. GitHub Issues is a first-class low-ceremony tier for `gh`-authed repos that opt in.

### Changesets and releases

Changesets are release input; Change folders are planning and implementation context. This keeps release conflicts low and versioning mechanics out of both `CHANGELOG.md` and the Change folder. Not yet implemented — no `.changeset/` directory exists, and release guidance needs reconciliation.

### Spike step

`spike`, not `dry-run` (`dry-run` already means preview across the Loaf CLI). A spike is a disposable attempt to learn whether the Change is executable: run in an isolated worktree, stop when enough unknowns are discovered, discard implementation output by default, and write findings back into the Change's planning and verification sections before real implementation begins.

## Implementation Units

In-document work packets — commit-boundary guides and review anchors, not tracked entities.

- **U1 — Pilot restructure.** This document, restructured to its own contract (done in shaping; you are reading the result).
- **U2 — Templates.** Extract a `docs/changes` change template from this file's structure, and make the Change-aware PR template distributable content under the shape skill (`content/skills/shape/templates/`) — Loaf's own `.github/` copy is the installed instance; materializing it into a consumer repo's `.github/` when absent belongs to the CLI (`change init` or bootstrap).
- **U3 — `loaf change init` and `loaf change check`.** `check` carries V1 (readiness vocabulary) and V2 (structure) from day one, with machine-readable output.

Everything beyond these three units was deliberately spun out (Decision 11) — see Follow-ups.

## Verification Contract

Executable (machine-checkable):

- **V1.** `loaf change check` exits non-zero on violations: status-like frontmatter — the banned keys (`readiness`, `status`, `state`), any frontmatter value matching the canonical state vocabulary (Decision 22: `backlog`, `shaping`, `todo`, `in-progress`, `review`, `merged`, plus `released`), or legacy progress words (`active`, `done`, `archived`) — the field class is banned under any key name, not policed; frontmatter not opening the file at byte one (parsers depend on it; a template bug caught in external review earned this clause); malformed `YYYYMMDD-slug` folder naming; identity mismatch (`change:` vs folder slug, `created:` vs folder date); or missing Product Contract sections. External review round 4 proved the D22 vocabulary was pinned but ungated — this clause closes it. *(the pilot gate)*
- **V2.** `loaf change check` reports derived executability — Planning Contract, Implementation Units, Verification Contract, and Definition of Done present and non-empty — without failing a shaping-stage document, in machine-readable output following the `loaf check` findings shape. Non-empty means authored content: lines consisting only of bracket placeholders (`[...]`) or comments count as empty, so a freshly-templated Change reads not-executable until its tail is actually written (U3 found the literal reading let placeholder-only documents satisfy the V3 gate).
- **V3.** `loaf change check --require-executable` exits non-zero when the document is not executable — the CI gate for non-draft PRs and the implement-skill preflight.

Human review:

- **H1.** No status or readiness field exists on a Change; completeness reads from document structure and the PR's draft/ready state, and done is derived from Git state, PR review, and gates — never a mutable flag.
- **H2.** Cross-change context stays in SQLite/journal surfaces, not duplicated across Git folders.
- **H3.** A subsequent Change is shaped from the template without friction — the template earns its keep in use, not in review.

The convergence check formerly listed here (no `content/` instruction mints a numbered `SPEC-*`) moves to the guidance-sweep follow-up Change, which owns the surface it verifies. The shape-skill criteria (produces a Change without a spec; explains the CLI boundary) move to the shape-skill-rewrite Change.

## Definition of Done

- The change and PR templates ship as distributable content; `loaf change init/check` ships; V1–V3 pass.
- This pilot's PR is reviewed and merged with the change folder on main.
- At least one follow-up Change is shaped from the template (H3) — proof the contract works beyond its own pilot.
- H1–H2 confirmed in review.
- Durable outputs (below) landed, or explicitly deferred at merge time.
- `handoff.md` is removed before merge — a ready-to-merge PR still carrying the baton is a Decision 18 violation (external review round 3 caught it already stale mid-flight; mechanical enforcement lands with the ship amendment).

Follow-up Changes have their own Definitions of Done — this Change does not gate on them (they are successors, not dependencies).

## Durable Outputs

The mechanic (Decision 19): a Change is a delta against the durable spec corpus; ship's finalize step merges added/modified/removed behavior into `docs/specs/`, promotes durable `research/` evidence to `docs/knowledge/`, deletes `handoff.md`, and archives the folder as the chronological reasoning log.

To create or update after implementation proves the model:

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — artifact-model section rewritten: the git/SQLite split, Changes vs. specs repositioning.
- **ADR** — the shape-first hybrid Change model; annotates ADR-016's trichotomy where it concerns work artifacts, and records the Decision 9 indexing pin.
- **Spec repositioning** — specs become post-implementation behavior contracts under `docs/specs/<feature>/`: what is now true, not what was planned. ADRs stay sparse and retroactive. Reports stay temporary unless the evidence snapshot deserves citation.
- **Updated skills and docs** — shape (rewritten), breakdown (retired), `cli-reference` (`loaf change`), README.

## Critique Gate

Before implementation, explicitly challenge:

- Is the CLI surface still too large for what we know today?
- Is the skill doing deterministic work that belongs in the CLI, or the CLI claiming judgment that belongs in the skill?
- Is the Product Contract enough for this Change, or are Planning Contract sections genuinely needed first?
- Are we reintroducing progress states under the word "readiness"? (V1 should make this impossible — verify it actually does.)
- What can be deleted from existing skills once the CLI owns the invariant?
- What ceremony exercises every new lifecycle verb? If a command or state cannot name its ceremony, do not build it.
- Which acceptance criteria became executable gates, and which remain human review — and is that split still right?

## Follow-ups

Spun out of this Change by Decision 11, each to be shaped as its own Change — more of the model's surface gets dogfooded by construction:

- **shape-skill-rewrite** — rewrite `/shape` around the hybrid model, absorb breakdown (Decision 5), teach the CLI boundary, default draft-PR-at-shaping (Decision 3). Owns the shape-produces-Change-without-spec and explains-the-CLI verification criteria.
- **spec-conversion-and-guidance-sweep** — inventory the 24 active specs, convert genuinely in-flight ones (SPEC-055 first), freeze the rest; then sweep README and skills so nothing implies numbered specs. Conversion strictly before sweep (Decision 4). Owns the convergence check, and the ship-skill amendment: the harvest step and its mechanics — ledger, projection, rejection KB (Decisions 17, 21b, 21c) — delta-merge finalize (Decision 19), explainer guidance (Decision 20), and the two-axis (standards ∥ spec, never reranked) review discipline for Decision 15's stability-point reviews.
- **skill-surface-tightening** — every skill useful, trim unnecessary instructions, kill shadow/never-used skills and silent failures (Decision 8). Inventory payload from the mattpocock review: wire and use `disable-model-invocation` (documented, unimplemented, unused across all 34 skills — the exact shadow-instruction class this change hunts), a router skill with a stale-router-is-a-bug contract, bucket/lifecycle taxonomy (in-progress/deprecated), `cli-reference` as a thin pointer to `loaf --help`, context-load vs cognitive-load vocabulary for the audit, one-trigger-per-branch description discipline, and a rejection ledger for Loaf's own backlog. Loaf's `eval:routing` infrastructure is ahead of the reviewed repo — preserve and extend it as the audit's measurement tool.
- **spike-harness** — worktree provisioning, discard guarantee, writeback loop, plus the general Verification Contract format (SPEC-017 binary-R revival, detached from its task model, with the tautological-criterion guard: a criterion must have an independent source of truth). Blueprint: the reviewed repo's `prototype` skill — question-first, capture-the-answer, discard the shell but keep the validated core.
- **beyond-one-context coordination** *(new, Decision 21g; refined by 22)* — when a Change exceeds the smart-zone context budget or spans parallel sessions, implementation units graduate to claimable units in the tracker's native mechanics (issue task lists, sub-issues, assignment), indexed by `change.md`; wayfinder-style frontier over blocking edges is the proven design. Loaf never grows a task entity.
- **`loaf change archive`** — built when the first completed Change gives post-merge housekeeping its ceremony (Decision 2).

## Open Questions

- SPEC-017 binary-R revival details — format only, no task model import.
- Smallest useful spike harness (worktree provisioning: harness-native `EnterWorktree` vs. a `git worktree add` wrapper).
- Finalize mechanics, narrowed: Decision 19 defines *what* finalize does (delta-merge, promotion, archive); still open is the *trigger* — manual `/reflect`, an automatic nudge, or an explicit `loaf change finalize`.
- Release grouping language ("change bundle"?) and the smallest changesets integration that replaces conflict-prone changelog input.
- Conversion inventory specifics: which of the 24 active specs convert vs. freeze (owned by the conversion follow-up Change).
- Archive's long-term usefulness (Decision 21h): re-evaluate after several Changes finalize — keep the chronological log, or delete post-finalize with the merge commit as the archive.

## Source Inputs

- The `ce-loaf-analysis` working session (2026-07-04): the compound-engineering comparison, four deep codebase audits, and the executive report recommending the hybrid Change model, spike step, one-way federation, and gates-derived done — plus the 2026-07-05 interactive review that produced the Decisions section.
- `docs/changes/20260704-worktree-storage-bootstrap/plan.md`, the first branch-local Change pilot.
- Loaf report `report-codex-handoff-journal-first-audit` (SQLite-backed; its markdown render is intentionally uncommitted — cited by report identity per Decision 10) — drift, lifecycle vocabulary, capture closure, and unused-verb lessons.
- External (Codex) review of this Change, 2026-07-05 — branch integrity, source integrity, scope trim, and decision provenance.
- github.com/mattpocock/skills — three-lens adversarial review (skill inventory, workflow process, devil's advocate), 2026-07-06: the first deliberately disconfirming Source Input. Raw reports in `research/mattpocock-review/`; adjudicated in Decision 21. Contributed the opt-in draft PR, harvest-to-ceremony deferral, rejection harvesting, the glossary timing split, the evidence-format correction, the smart-zone budget, and the beyond-one-context escape hatch — and independently validated Decisions 9, 10, and 17's election rule.
- Loaf memory notes on brief-first, change-first, and `/ship` versus `/release`.
- `docs/STRATEGY.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — skills describe what to do; the CLI executes deterministic behavior.
- Prior `CR-*`/`/change` notes, historical context superseded by the no-ID, shape-verb direction.
- Gokul Rajaram's Product Spec post and sample: specs legible to humans and executable by agents — Problem, Hypothesis, Scope, User Experience, Acceptance Criteria/Evals, Success Metrics.
- NotebookLM notebook "Agile Product Management: From Shaping to Implementation" — Shape Up, GitHub Spec Kit, Linear, RAC/Lore, Compound Engineering, AI-agent spec writing. Its synthesized report, "The SDD Blueprint," independently converged on the delta-spec/archive cycle (Decision 19); its companion video is a communications artifact, not a design input. Evaluation in `research/external-inputs.md`.
- Thariq, "Using Claude Code: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of HTML" (x.com/trq212, also on the Claude blog) — HTML as agent output for specs, reports, PR explainers, and throwaway editors; markdown-diff caveat that motivates the Decision 20 format split.
- Delba Oliveira (x.com/delba_oliveira) — "read architectural changes first, then code": HTML before/after architectural walkthroughs as the PR review entry point (Decision 20).
