# External inputs evaluation — feeding Decisions 17–20

Write-once evidence (Decision 18): what each external input contributed to
this Change, evaluated 2026-07-06.

## The SDD Blueprint (NotebookLM report)

Synthesis of Shape Up, GitHub Spec Kit, Compound Engineering, RAC/Lore, and
product-spec practice, generated from the "Agile Product Management" notebook.

- **Independent convergence on our architecture** (its §4, "The Delta
  Strategy"): self-contained change folders holding delta specs; at launch,
  deltas merge back into main specs and the folder archives into a
  chronological log. Sources that have never seen Loaf describe
  `docs/changes/` → ship → `docs/specs/` → `docs/changes/archive/`. This
  became Decision 19 and retroactively strengthens Decision 2
  (archive-over-delete is half of a cycle, not a storage preference).
- **Feeds the Verification Contract format** (SPEC-017 revival, spike-harness
  follow-up): RFC 2119 requirement keywords and Given/When/Then scenarios.
- **Validates**: shaping as rough/solved/bounded; appetite over estimate;
  No-Gos; trackers as "calendar context" — our projection model in different
  words.
- **Conscious divergences kept**: it prescribes Tasks as a separate artifact
  (we collapsed them into in-doc units — litigated at Decision 5/13); its
  Spec→Plan→Tasks cascade is our single growing artifact.

The companion video ("How Spec-Driven Development Works", 74s) is a
communications artifact — useful as an onboarding-explainer pattern, no
design content beyond the report.

## Thariq — "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of HTML"

HTML as agent output format: information density (tables, SVG, interaction),
"the chance of someone actually reading your spec, report or PR writeup is
much much higher if it's in HTML," attach an HTML code explainer to every PR,
spec-exploration webs, throwaway editors with copy-as-prompt exports.

- **Motivates Decision 20's format split** — including its own limiting
  caveat: "HTML diffs are noisy and hard to review compared to Markdown."
  Contracts stay markdown (diffable, checkable); evidence goes HTML (read
  rendered, never diffed).
- This Change already dogfooded the pattern: the worked-examples decision aid
  in this directory resolved D13/D14 in one round after prose stalled.

## Delba Oliveira — architectural walkthroughs first

"You don't need to read code anymore. Read architectural changes first, then
code, if necessary" — HTML before/after walkthroughs (modules, dependencies,
seams, signatures, mermaid), conditioned on verification paths existing and
architecture being iterated upfront.

- **Names the review entry point** for implementation PRs (Decision 20): the
  walkthrough is the aid at Decision 15's stability-point review.
- Her two preconditions map to existing structure: "ways to verify" = the
  Verification Contract; "iterate architecture upfront" = shaping and the
  Planning Contract.

## research/change-structure-decision-aid.html

The comparison artifact (three section structures × two worked Changes, three
check semantics × three scenarios) that settled Decisions 13 and 14 —
preserved here as the first resident of `research/` and a live example of
Decision 20's evidence format.
