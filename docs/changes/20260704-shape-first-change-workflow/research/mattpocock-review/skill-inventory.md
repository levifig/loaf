# Skill-inventory report — mattpocock/skills vs Loaf's skill conventions

Evidence (Decision 18): verbatim final report from the inventory/authoring
lens of the three-agent review of github.com/mattpocock/skills, 2026-07-06.
Brief: full inventory, compare authoring conventions both ways, adoption
candidates for the skill-surface-tightening follow-up. Adjudication:
Decision 21 (payload routed to the skill-surface-tightening follow-up).

---

## 1. Full inventory of `mattpocock/skills`

**Scale**: 38 `SKILL.md` files, 2,629 lines total (avg 69 lines/skill,
longest is `productivity/teach` at 140 lines, shortest are 7-line
one-liners). Disclosed reference files (flat `.md`/`.sh` files beside
`SKILL.md`, not in a `references/` subdir) add another 1,753 lines. **Total
skill-system footprint: ~4,382 lines.**

**Bucket taxonomy** (`skills/<bucket>/`), documented in `CONTEXT.md`:
- `engineering/` (16 skills) and `productivity/` (5 skills) — **promoted**:
  must appear in top-level `README.md` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and
  get a human-facing docs page at `docs/<bucket>/<name>.md` published to
  `aihero.dev`.
- `misc/` (4) and `personal/` (2) — kept, not promoted, no docs page, flat
  README list.
- `in-progress/` (7) — drafts, excluded from the plugin entirely.
- `deprecated/` (4) — retired, one-line reason implicit in bucket membership
  (CHANGELOG spells out why: "`caveman` was a duplicate... never meant to be
  public", "`zoom-out` went unused in practice").

**Invocation is a documented, binary axis** (`.agents/invocation.md`): every
`SKILL.md` is either **model-invoked** (default; description stays loaded,
rich "Use when..." trigger phrasing, reachable by other skills) or
**user-invoked** (`disable-model-invocation: true`; description is a bare
one-liner, invisible to the model, reachable only by typing the name). Of the
20 skills in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, **11 are user-invoked, 9
model-invoked** — a deliberate, load-bearing split, not an afterthought.

**Frontmatter is minimal**: only `name`, `description`, optionally
`disable-model-invocation: true` and `argument-hint`. No `license`,
`compatibility`, `metadata`, or `allowed-tools` anywhere across all 38
skills.

**Reference organization**: no `references/` or `templates/` subdirectories.
Disclosed files sit flush in the skill's own folder, named for their content
(`DEEPENING.md`, `CONTEXT-FORMAT.md`, `AGENT-BRIEF.md`, `mocking.md`,
`tests.md`) — ALL-CAPS for "read this to understand a concept," lowercase for
narrower how-to files. Cross-skill sharing is explicitly **not** done via
`../other-skill/FILE.md` links (`.agents/invocation.md`): a skill that needs
another skill's material invokes that skill by name in prose ("Run the
`/grilling` skill"), never reaches across folders.

**Philosophy doc**: `skills/productivity/writing-great-skills/SKILL.md` (82
lines) + `GLOSSARY.md` (195 lines) is the skill-authoring meta-skill — the
direct analogue of Loaf's CLAUDE.md "Skill Development" section, but as a
live, invocable, versioned skill rather than static project doc. Root virtue:
**predictability** (same *process* every run, not same output). Core lever:
**context load** (cost of a model-invoked skill's always-loaded description)
vs. **cognitive load** (cost to the human of remembering a user-invoked skill
exists). Everything else — leading words, progressive disclosure,
granularity, pruning — is argued as a trade against those two costs.

**Router pattern**: `engineering/ask-matt/SKILL.md` (74 lines, user-invoked)
is a single skill that maps every user-invoked skill in the repo into named
flows ("the main flow: idea → ship", "on-ramps", "vocabulary underneath",
"crossing sessions", "standalone"), with an explicit rule: it must be re-read
and updated any time a user-reachable skill's role changes, "a router that
lies" being treated as a real failure mode.

**Dogfooded process artifacts**:
- `.out-of-scope/` at the repo root — Matt runs his own `triage` skill's
  "rejected feature request" convention on the skills repo itself. Three
  files record hard product-boundary decisions with reasoning and linked
  prior requests (e.g. `mainstream-issue-trackers-only.md`,
  `question-limits.md`, `setup-skill-verify-mode.md`).
- `.changeset/*.md` — pre-release notes are themselves design-rationale
  documents (e.g. `tdd-tautological-tests.md` explains *why* a new
  anti-pattern was added and where), consumed by `@changesets/cli` into
  `CHANGELOG.md` and a GitHub Actions release PR
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). This is the only automation in the repo
  — no lint, no schema check, no skill-behavior test.
- `.agents/adr/0001-*.md` — one ADR, applying the project's own
  `domain-modeling` skill to itself, justifying the hard/soft-dependency
  split for the `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` pointer.

**Setup/config pattern**: `setup-matt-pocock-skills` is a single,
explicitly-required, run-once, prompt-driven (not scripted) configuration
skill that seeds `docs/agents/{issue-tracker,triage-labels,domain}.md` and
writes a summary block into the repo's existing `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`.
Skills split into **hard-dependency** (`to-issues`, `to-prd`, `triage` —
explicit "should have been provided to you, run `/setup-...` if not") vs.
**soft-dependency** (`diagnosing-bugs`, `tdd`,
`improve-codebase-architecture` — vague "the project's domain glossary"
prose, degrades gracefully). That split is itself the subject of the one ADR.

**Human docs pages** (`docs/<bucket>/<name>.md`, e.g.
`docs/engineering/tdd.md`, `docs/engineering/code-review.md`): a second,
separate artifact per promoted skill, written to a fixed template
(`.agents/writing-docs.md`), published at `aihero.dev/skills-<name>`. It
explicitly must **not** restate `SKILL.md`'s steps — its job is orientation
(what it does in one paragraph naming the "defining constraint," when to
reach for it, how it fits the graph), not instruction.

## 2. Comparison against Loaf's conventions

**Size, file-by-file.** Loaf's 34 skills total 6,543 lines in `SKILL.md`
alone (avg 192, median ~130, max 1,393 — `content/skills/cli-reference/
SKILL.md`), plus 17,046 lines total including `references/`/`templates/`.
That's roughly **4x the per-skill footprint** of Matt's set (69 vs. 192 lines
in the top file; ~115 vs. ~501 lines including disclosed material). Picking
three near-equivalent pairs:

| Task | Matt (lines, all-inline) | Loaf (lines) |
|---|---|---|
| Debugging methodology | `engineering/diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md` — 134, self-contained, 6 numbered phases each with a checkbox completion criterion | `content/skills/debugging/SKILL.md` — 38 lines + 3 references = 473 total |
| Code review | `engineering/code-review/SKILL.md` — 89, includes the full 12-item Fowler smell baseline inline | No direct Loaf equivalent skill (review is a `foundations` reference + a `/code-review` slash skill, not compared 1:1 here) |
| Handoff | `productivity/handoff/SKILL.md` — 16 lines, all prose, no template file | `content/skills/handoff/SKILL.md` — 121 lines + `templates/handoff.md` |

Neither density is "wrong" in isolation — Loaf's `debugging` skill is itself
tight (38 lines) and defers detail via `references/`, which is exactly Matt's
"progressive disclosure" move. The difference is how much total material
survives behind the pointer: Matt's disclosed files are narrow and singular
(one glossary, one format spec); Loaf's `references/` directories tend to be
broader knowledge dumps (`typescript-development` has 14 reference files/556
lines, `orchestration` has 10/1,872, `foundations` has 8/1,171). That's a
defensible choice for genuine domain-knowledge skills
(`typescript-development` is reference material by nature — Matt has no
equivalent, since his repo is entirely process skills, no language/domain
skills at all), but it's the first thing worth re-auditing under his
"relevance" and "no-op" tests when doing the tightening pass.

**`content/skills/cli-reference/SKILL.md` (1,393 lines) is a structural
outlier worth flagging directly**: `npm run build:cli-ref` (`package.json:19`)
auto-generates it from `loaf --help` output. It is marked
`user-invocable: false` (pure reference, never meant to be typed), yet it's
"in-skill reference" at the very top of Matt's information-hierarchy ladder —
the exact case his `writing-great-skills` glossary calls **sprawl**: "a skill
simply too long... independent of whether the lines are stale or repeated...
push reference down behind context pointers." Every line is live and accurate
(it's generated), so it fails no "relevance" or "no-op" test, but the whole
file sits in context on every turn it's model-invoked, when the same
information is one `loaf <cmd> --help` shell call away. This is the single
clearest tightening candidate in the inventory.

**Invocation control is the load-bearing structural gap.** Loaf's own
`.claude/CLAUDE.md` documents `disable-model-invocation` as a real sidecar
field ("`true` for manual-only workflows"). I verified against the actual
build code (`internal/cli/build_claude_code.go:485`,
`internal/cli/build_opencode.go`) and the 34 `SKILL.claude-code.yaml` files:
**zero of Loaf's 34 skills set it.** The only lever any skill actually uses
is `user-invocable` (19 `true`, 15 `false`), and
`build_claude_code.go:482-488` shows what it controls: whether a
`/skill-name` slash-command stub gets generated. It does **not** strip the
skill's `description` from the model's context — that's a different mechanism
entirely from Matt's `disable-model-invocation`, which (per his
`.agents/invocation.md`) removes the skill from the model's reach altogether,
down to a bare one-line human-facing description. Concretely: skills like
`ship`, `release`, `wrap`, `handoff`, `housekeeping`, `idea` are
`user-invocable: true` with an `argument-hint` — clearly meant to be typed by
a human — yet their full trigger-rich descriptions sit in context on **every
single turn**, competing for the model's attention, with no way to opt out.
Matt's equivalent skills (`handoff`, `teach`, `to-prd`, `to-issues`,
`triage`, `setup-matt-pocock-skills`, `grill-me`,
`improve-codebase-architecture`) are all marked
`disable-model-invocation: true` for exactly this reason. This is the most
concrete, mechanically verifiable finding in this whole comparison, and it's
squarely inside the stated goal ("trim unnecessary instructions... kill
silent failures") — Loaf documents a cost-control mechanism it never uses.

**No "context load" vocabulary in Loaf's authoring guidance at all.** I
grepped for it: the only two hits (`content/skills/wrap/SKILL.md`,
`content/skills/interface-design/SKILL.md`) are incidental, unrelated to
skill design (one is about conversational context evaporating, the other is
UI cognitive load for end users). Loaf's CLAUDE.md optimizes for
token-count-of-a-single-file (`< 500 lines` per SKILL.md) and progressive
disclosure, but never names the recurring cost that *every model-invoked
skill's description is permanently resident regardless of file length* — 34
descriptions, all the time, every project. Matt's framing makes that cost a
first-class design variable with its own lever (`disable-model-invocation`)
and its own failure mode language (no-op, sediment, sprawl — tied explicitly
to *which* budget a line is spending).

**Router pattern**: Loaf has nothing structurally equivalent to `ask-matt`.
`orchestration/SKILL.md`'s "Topics" table and `foundations`' reference table
both function as *partial* routers, but neither is a user-invoked, standalone
map of "every user-facing skill and how they chain together" with an explicit
staleness contract ("a router that lies"). With 34 skills — comfortably past
what anyone holds in their head — this is the single highest-leverage
adoption candidate: a `/loaf` (or similarly named) router skill naming every
user-invocable skill, the flows they chain into (`idea → triage → shape →
breakdown → implement → ship`), and the standalone ones, would directly serve
the "every skill useful" half of the tightening mandate — a stale router is
also the cheapest way to *notice* a shadow skill.

**Lifecycle/bucket taxonomy**: Loaf's `content/skills/` is a flat namespace
of 34 peers with no visible distinction between core workflow skills,
domain-knowledge references, experimental/in-progress work, or anything
retired. Matt's `deprecated/` bucket (skills stay in the repo, visibly
retired, one-line reason in the README, excluded from the plugin manifest)
and `in-progress/` bucket (drafts, excluded from promotion) are a direct,
low-cost mechanism for exactly the "kill shadow/never-used skills" goal —
instead of silently deleting a skill (losing its history and any migration
notes) or leaving it live-but-abandoned (a shadow), it moves to a
clearly-labeled bucket that's mechanically excluded from what ships.

**Testing/evals — Loaf is ahead here, genuinely.** Matt's repo has zero
automated verification of skill behavior — the entire QA surface is prose
("It's working if" bullets on the docs pages) plus manual dogfooding. Loaf
has `cli/scripts/eval-skill-routing.mjs`, which calls the real Anthropic
Messages API with natural-language prompts per skill and checks routing
accuracy (`EXPECTED_SKILL_COUNT = 34`, `npm run eval:routing`), and
`cli/scripts/smoke-test.js`. This is real, if underused, evaluation
infrastructure that Matt's set doesn't have an equivalent of at all — worth
*preserving and extending* rather than importing anything from his side, and
worth pointing out since the user asked to be critical in both directions.

**A confirmed shadow skill inside Matt's own "disciplined" repo** — useful as
a caution against assuming his conventions are self-enforcing.
`skills/engineering/resolving-merge-conflicts/SKILL.md` exists, is
model-invoked, and has a published docs page at
`docs/engineering/resolving-merge-conflicts.md` (proving it was meant to be
promoted, per his own rule that only promoted skills get docs pages) — but it
appears in **neither** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` nor the top-level
`README.md`, and `ask-matt` never mentions it. That's a direct violation of
`CONTEXT.md`'s own stated rule ("every skill in `engineering/` or
`productivity/`... must have a reference in the top-level README.md and an
entry in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`"). Even a repo built entirely around "a
router that lies is a failure" has one skill that's invisible to its own
router. Take this as evidence that the *convention* (bucket + manifest +
docs-page + router, all kept in sync) is sound, but nothing in his tooling
actually checks the sync — it's discipline, not enforcement, and it still
slipped once.

## 3. Concrete adoption candidates for the skill-surface-tightening effort

1. **Wire up `disable-model-invocation` for real, and use it.** Add the
   frontmatter passthrough/merge in `internal/cli/build_claude_code.go` (and
   the opencode target) so a skill's own `SKILL.md` or sidecar can actually
   strip the description from model-context, then audit all 34 skills against
   Matt's test ("could the model usefully reach for this autonomously?") —
   not "is it reusable" (his explicit non-test). Strong candidates for
   `disable-model-invocation: true` by that test: `ship`, `release`, `wrap`,
   `handoff`, `housekeeping`, `idea`, `bootstrap`, `reflect` — all
   human-typed, deliberate-invocation workflows with an `argument-hint` that
   nobody wants the model firing autonomously mid-conversation. **Replaces**:
   nothing removed, but immediately shrinks the model's always-loaded
   description surface without touching a single workflow.

2. **Build a router skill** (`ask-matt` equivalent) that names every
   user-invocable Loaf skill, the flows they chain into, and the standalone
   ones — with the same "stale router is a bug" discipline written into its
   own maintenance rule. **Replaces**: the implicit expectation that a user
   already knows which of 34 skills to reach for; also becomes the natural
   place to *notice* the next `resolving-merge-conflicts`-style shadow skill,
   since writing the router forces a full skill census.

3. **Adopt the bucket/lifecycle taxonomy** (`core/`, `experimental/` or
   `in-progress/`, `deprecated/`) for `content/skills/`, matching Loaf's own
   `feedback_...` memory pattern of visible, reasoned decisions rather than
   silent deletion. **Replaces**: ad hoc decisions about whether an underused
   skill (candidates worth checking against `loaf journal search "skill("`
   invocation frequency: `power-systems-modeling`, `ruby-development`,
   `go-development` if this isn't a polyglot shop) gets deleted, ignored, or
   kept — gives "kill shadow/never-used skills" an actual destination bucket
   instead of a binary delete/keep call.

4. **Turn `cli-reference/SKILL.md` into a thin pointer.** Instead of
   mirroring 1,393 lines of `--help` output into context, have the skill tell
   the model to run `loaf <command> --help` directly (the CLI is already the
   source of truth the file is generated from) or push the generated content
   to a genuinely external reference (a plain doc, not a skill) the model
   reads on demand. **Replaces**: the 1,393-line always-available-if-
   model-invoked file with a ~20-line pointer skill; the real reference
   content still exists, just not duplicated into skill-context.

5. **Add a `.out-of-scope/`-style rejected-request ledger**, scoped to Loaf's
   own feature backlog (not per-installed-project) — a place to record "we
   decided not to add X to Loaf, here's why, here's who asked" the same way
   `.agents/adr/` records architecture decisions. **Replaces**: nothing
   existing; currently a rejected feature request just... isn't tracked
   anywhere durable, so the reasoning gets re-litigated if it resurfaces
   (this happened at least once in Matt's own repo per
   `.out-of-scope/mainstream-issue-trackers-only.md`'s "Prior requests" list,
   which is exactly the case it's designed to short-circuit).

6. **Borrow the `writing-great-skills` glossary structure, not its content,
   as the format for a Loaf-native equivalent.** Loaf's CLAUDE.md Skill
   Development section is good prose but has no compact, load-bearing
   vocabulary the way "leading word," "context load," "no-op," and "sediment"
   function in Matt's `GLOSSARY.md` — terms that are *reused* across skill
   reviews to make critique fast ("this line is a no-op," "this is
   sediment"). **Replaces**: nothing structurally, but gives the tightening
   effort itself a shared vocabulary to conduct the audit in, rather than ad
   hoc line-by-line judgment calls.

7. **Hard/soft-dependency split, explicit and named**, for skills that read
   shared config (Loaf's `.agents/loaf.json`, `integrations.linear.enabled`,
   etc.) — `orchestration/SKILL.md`'s Linear section already does this
   implicitly ("If ... `true`... use Linear... Otherwise: coordinate with the
   project journal") but it's not named as a repo-wide pattern the way Matt's
   ADR 0001 names it. **Replaces**: nothing; formalizes an existing but
   unstated distinction so new skills default to writing it correctly instead
   of re-deriving it.

## 4. Honest challenges to Loaf's conventions

- **The `references/` vs. flat-disclosed-file question is a real
  disagreement, not just style.** Loaf's CLAUDE.md mandates a `references/`
  subdirectory as the only progressive-disclosure mechanism; Matt explicitly
  never uses one — disclosed files sit flush in the skill folder, and naming
  (ALL-CAPS for concept references, lowercase for narrower how-tos) carries
  the signal a subdirectory would otherwise carry. His argument (implicit in
  the glossary's "co-location" entry) is that a subdirectory adds a
  navigation hop without adding information; the file's name is already the
  pointer. I don't think this is clearly wrong — a
  `references/typescript-development/api.md` vs. a flush `API.md` costs the
  model exactly one more directory listing to resolve, for zero
  disambiguation benefit when the skill folder has few enough files that
  flat-and-capitalized reads fine. Whether that scales to Loaf's biggest
  skills (14-15 reference files) is worth testing rather than assuming the
  subdirectory convention pays for itself.

- **Matt's `templates/` doesn't exist as a category at all** — where Loaf
  splits "structural artifact schema" (`templates/`) from "knowledge
  document" (`references/`), Matt just inlines templates directly in
  `SKILL.md` (the PRD template in `to-prd/SKILL.md`, the agent-brief template
  in `AGENT-BRIEF.md`) or in a same-tier disclosed file with no distinct
  category. Loaf's two-category split is more legible once you know the rule,
  but it's one more decision an author has to get right on every new skill
  ("is this a template or a reference?") for a distinction Matt's set gets
  along fine without. This challenges Loaf's CLAUDE.md's implicit assumption
  that the two categories pay for the extra authoring overhead.

- **No description-length discipline comparable to Matt's "one trigger per
  branch."** Loaf's CLAUDE.md description guidance ("Include user-intent
  phrases," "Be specific") is looser than Matt's explicit anti-duplication
  rule for descriptions ("Synonyms that rename a single branch are
  duplication... collapse them"). A quick spot-check of Loaf's descriptions
  (e.g. `debugging`: "diagnosing failures, tracking hypotheses, or fixing
  flaky tests" — plausibly three restatements of one branch rather than three
  distinct triggers) suggests this specific check is worth running
  project-wide, since it's exactly the sentence-level pruning the tightening
  effort wants and Loaf currently has no test for it.

- **Matt's repo has no domain/language skills at all** (no Python, no
  TypeScript, no database design) — his entire set is process/workflow, so
  his tightness numbers aren't fully comparable to Loaf's, which carries
  language/domain skills (`typescript-development`, `python-development`,
  `ruby-development`, `go-development`, `database-design`,
  `power-systems-modeling`, `infrastructure-management`, `interface-design`)
  that are legitimately reference-heavy by nature. It would be a mistake to
  apply his ~70-line average as a target line count for those skills; the
  honest comparison is Matt's process skills against Loaf's process skills
  (`orchestration`, `implement`, `triage`, `handoff`, `ship`, `release`,
  `wrap`, `housekeeping`, `bootstrap`, `shape`, `breakdown`) — and *those*
  are still 2-6x longer than his equivalents even excluding the
  domain-knowledge skills from the comparison.

- **No eval tooling on his side undercuts his own "predictability" framing.**
  He argues predictability is the root virtue a skill should be judged
  against, but the only verification mechanism in the repo is prose ("It's
  working if") and manual use — there's no equivalent of Loaf's
  `eval:routing` actually measuring whether a description reliably triggers
  the intended skill over the intended competitors. If predictability is the
  goal, his repo doesn't verify it any better than Loaf's does; Loaf's
  infrastructure is the stronger claim to the same virtue, just
  under-exercised (no `eval:routing` baseline was found committed anywhere I
  could see referenced from CI).
