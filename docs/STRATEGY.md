# Strategy

Loaf is an opinionated agentic framework for AI coding assistants. It ships portable skills, bounded agent profiles, target-native adapters, enforcement hooks, and a native CLI. This document states current strategy; detailed history and evidence remain in [Changes](changes/), [decision records](decisions/), [reports](reports/), and git history.

## Who This Serves

**Solo developers** need an agent workflow that reduces context-switching overhead, preserves work across conversations, and enforces quality without becoming more cumbersome than direct tool use.

**Teams** need consistent agent behavior across developers and harnesses, with auditable decisions, trustworthy quality checks, and installation behavior that does not require everyone to understand Loaf internals.

## Proven Principles

**Skills are the portable knowledge layer.** Shared authoring should remain the default, while target-specific adapters translate that knowledge into the strongest trustworthy native surface each harness exposes.

**The CLI is the protocol layer.** Skills describe judgment and workflow, the CLI performs deterministic state and filesystem operations, and hooks enforce or inject narrowly scoped behavior. Runtime behavior should not depend on prose reimplementing CLI logic.

**Continuity belongs to the project journal, not a session lifecycle.** Journal entries are project-scoped events correlated by an opaque harness identity. Context is derived at read time, and a wrap is an optional synthesis checkpoint rather than a transition.

**Managed installation requires ownership evidence.** Loaf should change installed content only when it can identify what it owns and verify the expected digest. Capability claims must be tied to exact client versions and installed runtime evidence rather than inferred from build output.

**Automation must fail within its evidence boundary.** Automatic completion remains disabled unless a target supplies trustworthy success evidence and a durable event identity. When a harness cannot distinguish the relevant traffic or lifecycle event reliably, an explicit fallback is preferable to a false guarantee.

**Release is separate from shipping.** A Change may land through one or more coherent pull requests; publishing a project version is a distinct operation over already-landed work. CI verifies reproducible outputs and must not silently repair the source branch.

## Current Priorities

- **Journal reliability across installed targets.** Converge content-addressed installation, target adapter ownership, capability diagnosis, and isolated installed-runtime dogfood without mutating users' production state.
- **Change-first workflow consistency.** New bounded work uses `docs/changes/YYYYMMDD-slug/change.md`, validated with `loaf change check`. Existing spec and task records remain supported compatibility surfaces until deliberately converted.
- **Evidence-driven target support.** Keep capability classifications conservative, version-pinned, and reproducible. Promote native behavior only after the installed target proves model-visible delivery; otherwise retain narrower runtime gating or an explicit fallback.
- **Durable knowledge with low ceremony.** Preserve decisions, discoveries, and operational lessons where later work can retrieve them, while removing lifecycle machinery and planning vocabulary that do not carry product meaning.

## Strategic Tensions

**Portability versus native leverage.** A shared skill should express the common contract, but each native adapter expands the compatibility and test surface. Native behavior earns its place only when it is observable and maintainable.

**Automation versus explainability.** Invisible automation is convenient until it fails. Ownership manifests, diagnostics, isolated smoke tests, and explicit degradation make failures inspectable without requiring hand-edited global configuration.

**Convention versus compatibility.** Change-first is the current model for new work, while existing SQLite tasks, `SPEC-*` records, and their CLI commands remain real supported data. Compatibility should preserve access without keeping retired workflow assumptions in current guidance.

**Durability versus noise.** The journal must retain information that changes future decisions, not duplicate lifecycle state or syntheses that can be derived from source, git, and pull requests.

## Open Questions

- Which target-native signals can provide durable event identity and trustworthy success evidence without coupling Loaf to unstable client internals?
- How should scheduled client-version discovery produce reviewable candidate evidence without automatically changing capability classifications?
- Where does target-native behavior materially improve the user experience enough to justify its maintenance and installed-test burden?
- How well does Change-first workflow adoption hold outside Loaf itself, particularly for teams with existing trackers and conventions?
