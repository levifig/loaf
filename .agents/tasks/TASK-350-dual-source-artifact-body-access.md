# TASK-350: Implement dual-source artifact body access

## Description

Add SPEC-043 Track 1: shared body read/write helpers, Markdown import backfill
into `artifact_bodies`, dual-source read precedence, and same-transaction FTS
maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shared state helpers upsert/read/delete `artifact_bodies` rows by project, entity kind, entity id, and body kind.
- [ ] Body reads prefer SQLite `artifact_bodies` and fall back to `body_source_id` Markdown files when no SQLite body exists.
- [ ] Markdown migration imports current artifact bodies into `artifact_bodies` without mutating Markdown files.
- [ ] FTS rows are upserted/deleted from the same Go transaction as body writes; no triggers maintain FTS.
- [ ] Existing `show`/`trace` behavior for specs, tasks, ideas, brainstorms, sessions, reports, and sparks does not regress.
- [ ] Multi-paragraph imported bodies round-trip byte-exact.

## Verification

```bash
go test ./internal/state -run 'ArtifactBody|MarkdownMigration|Show|Trace' -count=1
```
