# TASK-063: Audit and rewrite descriptions for all skills

Audit and rewrite the `description` field in every skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter to optimize context-based triggering.

## Description formula (100-300 chars, max 1024)

1. **Third-person action verb opener**: "Covers...", "Establishes...", "Coordinates..."
2. **Specific scope terms**: key terms Claude will match against
3. **User-intent phrases**: "Use when..." with natural language triggers
4. **Negative routing**: "Not for..." to disambiguate confusable skills
5. **Success criteria** (workflow skills only): "Produces..."
