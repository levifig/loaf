description: Explains Loaf Flow authority, artifacts, and ceremony boundaries. Use when deciding where work belongs or how one Flow stage hands evidence to another. Not for provider-specific tracker operations.

# Loaf Reference

Loaf supplies the ceremony, judgment, and artifact shape. The canonical tracker supplies shared work identity and state; the current harness supplies the already-configured connection used to reach it.

## Critical Rules

- Treat the live native tracker record as the only shared work record.
- Use Loaf templates to write or evaluate tracker content, never to create a second authority.
- Let the harness own connection discovery, authentication, and credential handling.
- Keep code and deliberately promoted artifacts in Git; keep private continuity out of tracker fields.
- Read [Authority Model](references/authority-model.md) before assigning a new responsibility.
- Read [Flow Semantics](references/flow-semantics.md) before changing a ceremony or handoff.

## Verification

- The tracker record contains the canonical definition, relationships, and workflow state.
- Every mutation names the native destination and is verified with an authoritative read.
- No local work record, tracker proxy, or reconciliation path was introduced.
- Artifact fields match the applicable shared template exactly.
