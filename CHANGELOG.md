# Changelog

This project follows [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). `## [Unreleased]`
is a Loaf workflow staging section for curated entries before release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Amp's generated plugin keeps enforcement hooks and registers Loaf Medium / Loaf Ultra orchestrators plus Grok implementation, Luna review, and pinned Sol-oracle tools. Grok and Luna are not picker modes. Built-in Amp medium is not rewritten. Once invoked, pinned agents fail closed with no model, reasoning, or capability substitution (LOAF-61).

### Changed

- `loaf issue start` walks to the shippable root of the issue tree. Only that root gets `issue/<root-alias>` and a worktree; starting a child creates or joins the root workspace and marks the child active. `loaf issue stop` on a child that does not own a worktree names the root (LOAF-50).

### Fixed

- Development builds stage native targets before replacing `bin/native` and `bin/.loaf-dev-commit`, so a later target failure cannot leave a new binary reporting a previous commit. Activation updates a Loaf-owned launcher pointer and creates `~/.local/bin/loaf` only when that name is absent; existing operator-owned paths are never replaced, and activation failures no longer fail a successful native build. Release tags that are not strict SemVer fail resolve instead of being skipped as dev identities.
- `loaf issue start` on a child refuses if the root workspace is missing or the root is already `done` / archived, instead of joining a stale or closed workspace.
- Homebrew formula generation pins an explicit `version` so older `brew` does not infer `64` from `darwin-arm64` in the asset URL.
- CI workflows use Node 24 Actions (`actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v7`, `actions/setup-go@v7`) so runs stop warning about deprecated Node 20.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Local issue aliases derive from the project slug (`VCAM-1`, `CROSSFADE-1`). `LOAF` is only the fallback for unnameable paths and the loaf repo itself. Project bootstrap records `issue.authority` and `issue.prefix` in `.agents/loaf.json` (`loaf init`, and `loaf config check --fix` when creating a missing file). `loaf issue identity --prefix` / `--authority` persist that choice; for Linear the prefix is the team key and local aliases are not rewritten. `--align` rewrites a leaked `LOAF-*` prefix and writes the result back to loaf.json. `loaf doctor` and `loaf state doctor` name leak, missing config, and config drift.
- `loaf issue retitle` replaces an issue title. `loaf issue edit` stays body-only.
- `loaf issue absorb` turns leftover SQLite work into a fresh issue, or dismisses it, without unfreezing the old write commands. A single ref stays leftover-open only. `--all` projects the current project's open tasks and non-terminal intents; `--all --history` also mints done tasks as done issues and archived tasks as cancelled issues, and refuses when the project already has independently created issues. `--dry-run` rehearses the projector. The old alias stays provenance only. Freeze errors name the 0.5.0 horizon. `loaf doctor` and `loaf state doctor` inventory leftover SQLite work and name `loaf issue absorb --all [--history] --dry-run`; they do not mint. Housekeeping and orchestration name leftover absorb instead of treating leftover rows as read-only ([#165](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/165), LOAF-42).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-17

### Unified Issue work model
- Unify the Loaf work model on one recursive Issue entity (#164) (0032852a): Change, spec, task, and Intent collapse into Issue and Release. New `loaf issue` CLI with definition-of-done criteria, derived readiness, issue-bound worktrees, and Linear identity delegation. Releases become retroactive (`loaf release suggest` / `cut`). `loaf change` and `loaf spec` are retired; `loaf task` and `loaf intent` writes are frozen with deprecation redirects pending the LOAF-42 migration.

### Unattributed
- Capture the main-push-policy brief (1333443f)
- Capture the linear-native-coordination brief with the model-informing mandate (5987614c)
- Bring the strategy queue current with v0.2.21 and the revised ADR-026 (e9e2450b)
- Revise ADR-026 with arc-boundary release semantics under a living-record ADR convention (8eac0210)

## [0.2.21] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- `loaf state migrate alias-orphans` retires entity rows orphaned from the alias registry — the damage left when a project rekey invalidated every derived ID and a later import re-minted the tree. Classification proves twin-ship (legacy-salt derivation, or window-gated content identity) and iterates to a fixed point; unproven rows refuse by default and take explicit `--retire`/`--realias` dispositions that rehearse in preview; apply takes a backup first and writes an fsynced rollback manifest that restores every deleted row ([#159](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/159)).
- `loaf state migrate journal-duplicates` is the sibling repair for journal entries, which carry no aliases: identical `(type, scope, message)` twins across the two import windows retire their older copy, ambiguous groups refuse, and the reference sweep shares one polymorphic-table enumeration with alias-orphans so the two repairs cannot drift ([#159](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/159)).
- `loaf state doctor` now checks alias parity: for every project and aliased entity table, raw row counts must equal alias-reachable counts with zero dead aliases. Divergence reports as an error diagnostic naming the repair command — identity damage is detectable the day it happens instead of discoverable by accident at housekeeping ([#159](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/159), ADR-028).
- `loaf hooks list`, `loaf hooks enable`, and `loaf hooks disable` operate individual hooks from the installed catalog. Enablement lives in the global database, user-scoped and host-local — absence means enabled, disable records tombstone rather than delete — and every verb reprojects the target's hook file through the full reconciler under a per-target lock ([#161](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/161)).

### Changed

- Codex and Cursor hook files are no longer whole-file managed artifacts guarded by a digest. Install and upgrade now converge Loaf-owned entries per hook point — adding missing ones, updating changed ones, removing retired ones, and absorbing an operator-deleted entry once as a disabled record — while every non-Loaf entry survives value-identical and order-stable. Drift refusals are gone as a class, including the refusal on user-modified `hooks.json` files frozen since the pre-reset releases; integrity violations still fail closed and preserve the file ([#161](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/161)).
- Markdown import resolves identity through the alias registry before deriving an ID — existing entities, sources, and journal rows are reused instead of re-minted, colliding sparks receive numbered aliases, and a spark whose message normalizes to an empty slug gets a content-hash alias so no row is born unreachable. Derived IDs are now mint-once opaque keys (ADR-028); for healthy databases a re-import is byte-stable ([#159](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/159)).

### Fixed

- A project rekey followed by a markdown re-import could silently fork the identity space — every artifact re-inserted as an invisible twin, aliases re-pointed to the copies, and the list surfaces disagreeing with the housekeeping scanner about how much work exists. The importer fix removes the cause; the migrations repair existing damage; doctor parity detects any recurrence ([#159](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/159)).

## [0.2.20] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **Breaking: the version line resets from `2.0.0-alpha.19` to `0.2.20`.** Releases are plain major-zero numbers with no prerelease suffix. Nineteen alphas over two months each implied a 2.0 that was never close, and the implied ceremony is why fixes sat unshipped; under the new scheme the patch slot counts releases within a minor, so a merged fix is a patch bump and nothing more. `0.3.0` is the next stabilization epoch and `1.0.0` a milestone to reach rather than defend. In SemVer terms this is a deliberate downgrade: **run `loaf upgrade` once after installing 0.2.20** so every harness's `.loaf-version` marker is restamped. Until you do, markers written by `2.0.0-alpha.19` sit above the new binary and `loaf doctor` reports each harness as ahead of it ([#153](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/153), ADR-026).
- The changelog history is renumbered 1:1 onto the new scheme with entry content untouched: `2.0.0-alpha.N` → `0.2.N`, `2.0.0-dev.N` → `0.1.N`, the four `pre.<timestamp>` builds → `0.1.50`–`0.1.53`, and the pre-CLI 1.x era collapsed into an authored `0.1.0` anchor. This file is the sole carrier of the renumbered history — no tag or artifact carries the new numbers for anything before `0.2.20`, and GitHub keeps exactly a `v0.1.0` era marker and `v0.2.20`. ADR-026 holds the translation table; pre-reset ADRs keep their original citations as dated records ([#153](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/153)).

### Added

- A dev build reports an identity of its own — `<major>.<minor>.<unix timestamp>` with a `(dev build)` suffix — so a local build and a release are unmistakable on sight (`0.2.20` versus `0.2.1786022455`) instead of differing only by the absence of build metadata. A timestamp patch is valid SemVer and sorts above every release in the minor, which is the truth about a machine running its own build. The identity takes two facts rather than one: no release build metadata, and a resolved distribution carrying `go.mod` beside its content — so the locally built binaries this repository ships at a release tag (the Claude Code plugin marketplace payload, and what `npx github:levifig/loaf` compiles during install) keep reporting their release version. Tracked build artifacts always carry the release version; dev identity is binary-level only ([#153](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/153), ADR-026).
- The release pipeline refuses its ceremony for a dev build's version. The refusal sits on the release snapshot, the one derivation dry-run, apply, and post-merge all read, so a timestamp-magnitude candidate is rejected once rather than in three places; the release workflow mirrors it on the way in, skipping cleanly when such a tag is pushed instead of failing downstream on a tag/version mismatch. The guardrail is drawn at ceremony, not at visibility: commits, lightweight tags, and prerelease-marked uploads stay available ([#153](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/153)).

### Fixed

- `loaf release --post-merge` no longer demands a version-file diff from a release commit whose version files already carry the version being tagged. Guardrail 5 asked every release commit to touch both `CHANGELOG.md` and a version file, which assumes the version flip happens in the release commit — false for a release that carries its own bump as already-landed work, where the only honest release commit is changelog-only and the absent diff was read as "this does not look like a release commit". Guardrail 4 asserts the stronger fact one step earlier — every version file at HEAD equals the candidate, aborting the run when it does not — so the version-file demand is redundant in exactly the case where it used to block, and it is now dropped only under that proof. The changelog half never relaxes: a release commit that writes no release notes is refused as before, and so is one whose diff carries neither.
- The release cohort gate no longer reads execution provenance from history shape alone. It graded a Change executed only when some commit in ancestry flipped a task box from `- [ ]` to `- [x]` while touching code outside `docs/changes/` — precisely what a squash merge rewrites, so a fully implemented, receipt-verified Change arrived on main with its packets created already-checked, graded "not executed", and blocked `loaf release --post-merge` on its own cohort. A member now grades executed when that flip exists in ancestry **or** when a fresh verify receipt vouches for a folder whose every committed task box is checked. A receipt binds the tree, and no merge strategy rewrites a tree, so the grade holds under fast-forward, merge commit, rebase, squash, and any cleanup-then-merge hybrid. The shaping-only defense is untouched: checked boxes with nothing vouching for them still refuse, a stale or digest-mismatched receipt vouches for nothing, and checkbox completeness reads committed HEAD rather than the working tree, so a dirty checkout cannot open the gate. The refusal a receipt-less squash earns now names that cause and the one command that clears it — `loaf change verify <folder>`, then commit the receipt — instead of the bare "is not executed", and the lower-cohort warning reads the same grade, so a squash-landed cohort stops reporting itself incomplete.
- `loaf doctor`'s harness-content-drift advice no longer treats a marker above the binary as proof the binary is behind. A renumbered version line leaves an older marker sitting above a newer binary, and the only advice offered was to upgrade a binary that was already current; both remedies are now named. A marker of timestamp magnitude — a dev build's clock, above everything published by construction — is never read as evidence the binary is stale ([#153](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/153)).

## [0.2.19] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- `loaf upgrade` — the command for bringing an existing installation current, split from install by scope. It syncs every installed harness config directory from the installed distribution and runs deprecation cleanup wherever you invoke it, then refreshes project surfaces (fenced sections, symlinks, migrations, and the MCP recommendation in `.agents/loaf.json`) only when the working directory is a detected Loaf repo — so it is safe to run from anywhere and no longer scatters project files into unrelated folders. Detection is tiered: a registered project or a fenced `AGENTS.md` marker proceeds on its own and prints the basis, legacy `.agents/` folders alone ask first, and nothing detected skips the project half with a note — and the marker must be a complete managed section with a header that parses, so a lone opening fence is not mistaken for one and a section that has been tampered with routes to the confirmation prompt instead of proceeding on its own. `--to <target>` narrows the sync to an already-installed target and errors on an uninstalled one, pointing at `loaf install --to`. The `--dry-run --json` planning surface moves here. A harness that cannot be synced does not stop the others: the run completes the remaining targets and the project part, then names what failed and exits non-zero. Both commands leave a `.agents/loaf.json` they cannot use exactly as they found it — one that does not parse as an object, and one whose bytes never come back at all — reporting the path and the reason instead of replacing the file with defaults.
- A currency advisory closes `loaf upgrade`: when it can identify the running binary's install channel — Homebrew, npm, or a dev checkout — it reports the available version and that channel's exact upgrade command, and never runs it. The check is best-effort inside a one-second budget and degrades silently, so upgrade stays fully functional offline.
- Harness content drift is now visible instead of silent. `loaf doctor` gains a `harness-content-drift` check comparing each installed harness's `.loaf-version` marker to the running binary — naming `loaf upgrade` for stale content, and blaming the binary when a marker is ahead of it. The check offers no repair, but it warns like the other drift checks, so `loaf doctor` exits non-zero while any harness is out of step. Conversation start carries a one-line nudge in the harnesses Loaf delivers content to — Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode — when the invoking harness's content is behind; Claude Code stays silent because its content ships on the plugin-marketplace channel that `loaf upgrade` does not touch.

### Changed

- `loaf install` is now onboarding only: deploying Loaf into a folder that does not have it, or adding a harness that is not installed yet. Every project write — `AGENTS.md`, the fenced section, symlinks, and the MCP recommendation in `.agents/loaf.json` — sits behind a consent prompt outside a Loaf repo, and a non-interactive run reports the consent it needs rather than assuming it. Inside a Loaf repo the project half no-ops and points at `loaf upgrade`.

### Removed

- **Breaking: `install --upgrade` is removed.** The flag now errors with a pointer to `loaf upgrade`, as do `--dry-run` and `--json` on install; the documented dry-run planning flow is `loaf upgrade --dry-run --json`. The plan document stays at contract version 1 and every field keeps its name, type, and meaning — the only value that changed is `command`, which reads `upgrade`. One optional object is new: `project_part` (`in_scope`, `tier`, `confirmation_required`, `bases`) reports the detector gate and is omitted entirely for callers that plan project files unconditionally, so their document is byte-identical to before.

## [0.2.18] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- `loaf release` refuses to create a release commit or tag when installed-smoke capability evidence is invalid or stale against the just-rebuilt tree — on every mutating path (`--pre-merge`, direct, and `--post-merge` as guardrail 9); refusals name the smoke runners and the re-record-after-rebuild ordering, and projects without `config/target-capabilities.json` are untouched ([#147](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/147))
- Rerunning a release after an evidence refusal is a verified resume: prepared-tree dirt is restored and regenerated, re-recorded receipts are the only operator input carried through, and untracked files under generated roots refuse by name ([#147](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/147))
- `--post-merge` recovery accepts a single receipt-only repair commit atop the release commit, classified against the parent commit's registry ([#147](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/147))
- The release skill states the evidence-ordering rule (re-record after the `--pre-merge` rebuild) and the guardrail-9 recovery flow; STRATEGY and ARCHITECTURE record the arc's proven principles ([#147](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/147), [#149](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/149))

### Fixed

- Registry and candidate-artifact reads in the release gate refuse symlinked or irregular paths through a shared component-wise walk, so validated bytes and committed bytes cannot diverge ([#147](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/147))
- The 2.1.207 smoke narrative names its receipt's supersession instead of linking a removed file ([#148](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/148))

## [0.2.17] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- `/pitch` — the human-invoked entry stage of the Loaf Flow at both scales: a problem-discovery interview (destination pinning, scenario stress-testing, challenge stance) that authors a change-scale `brief.md` via `loaf change init <slug> --brief`, or a project-scale `docs/BRIEF.md` that bootstrap consumes, both on one shared problem-space skeleton ([#145](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/145))
- `loaf change init` promotes capture-only change folders to the full anatomy in place — state-matrixed with atomic, overwrite-free, resumable publication; duplicate rejection for materialized folders is unchanged ([#145](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/145))
- Bootstrap recognizes pitched BRIEFs (`source: pitch`) with a gap-only interview and closes with series-prep: the project's initial arc minted as captured promise carriers, one docs-only commit each, validated before landing ([#145](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/145))
- The CLI and release skill advise the sanctioned PR-based release flow with state-aware guardrails ([#146](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/146))
- Operating docs for the flow: `docs/knowledge/loaf-flow.md` and ADR-025 (entry-stage model, amending ADR-022's brief semantics) ([#145](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/145))

### Changed

- `/shape` consumes pitched briefs — restates the problem and grills solution-space only — and `/triage` gains the "pitch" disposition for items needing problem discovery ([#145](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/145))
- `/explore` and `/brainstorm` leave the user-facing slash surface: they remain agent-side techniques, and user entry routes to `/pitch` ([#145](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/145))
- Brief templates at both scales carry the shared problem-space skeleton, and the release-cohort vocabulary reads as the "target version" bucket in the operating docs ([#145](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/145))

## [0.2.16] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
- Receipt freshness is now judged from repository content, not commit history: `loaf change verify` writes schema v2 receipts bound to a masked root-tree digest, so the release gate returns the same verdict on every clone under squash, rebase, or merge-commit merge strategies ([#144](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/144), ADR-024).
- `loaf change verify` refuses to run on a dirty tracked worktree and voids a receipt whose run mutated tracked files or moved HEAD; re-verifying a cohort composes cleanly because receipts and report boards are exempt from the dirty check ([#144](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/144)).
- Schema v1 receipts are no longer read: the gate blocks them with a re-verify remedy. No receipts exist in the wild, so there is nothing to migrate ([#144](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/144)).

### Fixed
- Release-gate receipt checks no longer crash with a bare `exit status 128` on clones where the verified commit is unreachable; every receipt state yields a reasoned block naming the change folder, the cause, and a copy-pasteable remedy ([#144](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/144)).
- Cohorts of two or more changes can all hold fresh receipts simultaneously; previously each member's receipt commit staled the others ([#144](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/144)).
- CLI git failures surface stderr in returned errors instead of a bare `exit status N` ([#144](https://github.com/levifig/loaf/pull/144)).

## [0.2.15] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Change anatomy: `loaf change init` scaffolds `change.json` + `shape.md` + a seeded `tasks/` (with `--brief` capture mode); task packets in `tasks/TASK-NNN-slug.md` are delegation briefs whose checkbox flips in delivering commits are the execution evidence.
- Release cohorts: a change may declare `target_release`, and cutting that version stable requires every cohort member executed and receipt-verified, with block messages that name their remedy; prereleases always flow, and retargets are reviewable diffs that surface at check and preflight.
- `loaf change verify` runs the executable criteria declared in `shape.md` (`Command:` plus an enforced `Expect` grammar — `exit N`, `` contains `text` ``) from the repository root and writes a committed `receipts/verify.json` the gate reads from HEAD.
- Projections: `loaf change tasks --json` (stable-ID task index with relations and derived completion), `loaf change show` (derived state and the PR set from squash subjects), and `loaf change list` (units and cohorts, `--target X.Y.Z` filtering) share one derived-state ladder.
- `loaf change report new` stamps authored HTML reports under `reports/` from a closed kind registry (`approval`, `review`, `visual`, `audit`, `note`) and prints the design language.

### Changed

- The release pipeline resolves one immutable snapshot (version files, bump, candidate, commit range) per invocation and asserts it before acting; `--post-merge` keys on the prepared version — a prepared prerelease publishes through the valve, a prepared stable gates its cohort, and the tag always equals the version files.
- Legacy single-file `change.md` remains first-class until a named removal boundary; conversion to the new anatomy is a sanctioned atomic replace with all task checkboxes unchecked.
- `loaf change list` retires `--lineage` in favor of the units/cohort projection.

### Fixed

- State surfaces (`show`, `list`, `check --json`) warn instead of silently demoting when structural evaluation or committed-receipt reads fail.
- `validate-commit` attributes heredoc bodies to their own command, and release tooling labels prereleases correctly (#138).

## [0.2.14] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- `loaf check --hook artifact-names` rejects artifact filenames that name the work unit which produced them. A Change, spec, task, or issue points at its artifacts; an artifact never points back, because the directory containing it already records that provenance, and a name carrying a work identity has to be renamed to stay true. The check runs fail-closed at commit time, judges tracked files only, matches Loaf's artifact directories by basename so relocating them needs no configuration, and grandfathers anything whose front matter records a terminal state (`final`, `archived`, `done`, or `completed`) at any nesting depth. Versions and timestamps remain legal because they identify rather than refer, as does a numbered record living in the directory that owns it, such as `SPEC-042` in `specs/` or `ADR-007` in `docs/decisions/`. **After upgrading, a commit that touches an artifact whose name carries a work identity fails until the file is renamed.** Run `loaf check --hook artifact-names --advisory` to list findings without blocking; record the provenance in a front matter field instead, where it stays readable and updatable.

### Changed

- Managed `AGENTS.md` fence markers are fingerprint-only (`sha256=` of the body, no installer version stamp), so `loaf install --upgrade` no longer rewrites the marker on every release when the body is unchanged. The first upgrade after this change strips the legacy `v…` stamp once; a pre-change binary that encounters the new header refuses with a malformed-fingerprint error until you upgrade the binary.
- Capability smoke runners require an explicit client executable, expected version, and receipt path, and publish a receipt only after both the proof and its cleanup succeed. Each runner is named for the target and context mode it verifies rather than for the workstream that commissioned it, its retained evidence follows the same rule, and marker prefixes are target-scoped so one target's proof cannot be presented as another's. Scripted callers must pass `--client`, `--expected-version`, and `--receipt`.
- Living project documentation and distributed skill guidance describe Change-first work in permanent language, without implementation-unit names, numbered development stages, or volatile inventory counts that go stale the moment anything is added. Historical Change, SPEC, and ADR citations remain where they serve as decision provenance.
- The `ship` skill handles pull requests stacked on the one being landed. It detects child pull requests before the merge, refuses to delete a head branch while a child still points at it, and afterwards retargets, rebases, and re-verifies each child. Neither repair is optional: GitHub does not reliably retarget a child when its base merges, and a squash merge leaves the child carrying commits that would re-apply its parent's entire diff.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Markdown re-import treats SQLite as the status authority: statuses are insert-only (a real normalized status fills only a stored `unknown`), archived entities stay archived through any number of re-imports, and kept-vs-incoming divergences are reported in the result instead of silently applied (#132).
- `loaf migrate markdown --dry-run` simulates the full apply pipeline against a disposable database snapshot and reports exactly what apply would do (`mode: simulation` with an `import_report` of reclaimed origins, skipped entries, and status divergences); without a database or registered project it returns an honestly labeled `mode: inventory` file count (#132).

### Fixed

- The managed instructions block installed into project `AGENTS.md`/`.claude/CLAUDE.md` now names the Loaf `orchestration` skill instead of linking `skills/orchestration/SKILL.md`, a path that does not exist in project checkouts; existing installs pick up the corrected block on the next `loaf install --upgrade` (#129).
- `loaf spec archive` accepts the canonical terminal status `done` everywhere the legacy `complete` spelling worked, in both SQLite and markdown-only projects, and markdown import normalizes spec status with `TASKS.json` precedence — completed specs archive without hand-editing statuses (#130).
- Blocking-hook remediations are followable end-to-end: `loaf check` remediation commands resolve legacy report references, malformed stamped renders route to finalize instead of storing markdown as prose, archived reports refuse body edits before mutation, and hand-edited durable renders are detected as divergent (#131).
- `loaf migrate markdown` re-import no longer aborts wholesale on journal-origin collisions: origins matching the schema-0011 backfill fingerprint are reclaimed as migration provenance, every other foreign-provenance entry is skipped untouched and listed, and a project blocked since the 0011 upgrade imports cleanly (#132).
- Manual relationships created with `loaf link` are never claimed or deleted by markdown re-import, even when they share the importer's deterministic relationship id (#132).

## [0.2.12] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Codex-managed guidance, hooks, and execpolicy rules now render the stable PATH entrypoint (for example `/opt/homebrew/bin/loaf`) instead of the versioned Homebrew Cellar target, so package upgrades no longer invalidate installed policy or strand running Codex tasks; symlink-target validation against forbidden roots is unchanged and now covers both symlink directions (#127).

### Fixed

- Recognize the relationship provenance written by Intent creation, Exploration creation, and legacy-deferral conversion: every writer now shares one closed origin vocabulary, so `loaf doctor` no longer reports permanent unknown-origin warnings on healthy databases (#127).
- `loaf state repair relationship-origin` reclassifies the retired legacy origins (`intent-create`, `legacy-conversion`, `exploration-create`, `system`) to `command`, backup-first and idempotent; bare invocation is reclassify-only, `--origin imported|manual` still enables the missing-origin backfill, and unrecognized foreign origins are reported but never rewritten (#127).
- Live help agrees with dispatchable commands: `loaf state migrate --help` lists all six sources from the same registry that dispatches them, and bare or leaf `--help` invocations (`migrate`, `conversation handle add`, `exploration conversation add`) print usage and exit 0 (#127).

## [0.2.11] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Classify schema-11 databases as upgradable behind-schema state instead of invalid, restoring the backup-first `loaf state migrate schema --apply` path for every installation upgrading from v0.2.9 — with or without an applied journal-first ceremony (#124).

## [0.2.10] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Track directions as first-class Intents with append-only dispositions: `loaf intent create/defer/resume/resolve/show/list`, retry-safe compound deferral through one canonical per-project operation mapping, and immutable self-sufficient deferral payloads (#122).
- Develop inquiries as durable Explorations that survive compaction and harness changes: `loaf exploration create/checkpoint/list/context` with four required portable checkpoint fields capped at 4096 bytes each, plus explicit conversation provenance through `loaf conversation create/show/list/handle add/observe` (#122).
- Read the local intake queue with `loaf intake list`: unresolved sparks, ideas, brainstorms, Intents, and pre-conversion legacy deferrals, each projected exactly once with exact follow-up commands (#122).
- Convert historical `journal defer` records into canonical deferred Intents with `loaf state migrate deferrals`: a non-mutating dry-run manifest and a backup-first, rerunnable apply that preserves every legacy row and links historical provenance (#122).
- Diagnose and plan maintenance without mutation: `loaf doctor --json` mirrors the human checks read-only, and `loaf install --upgrade --dry-run --json` reports the complete upgrade plan with consent requirements (#122).
- New `/explore` workflow skill: divergent inquiry with checkpoint discipline, portable resumption, and Intent capture (#122).

### Changed

- `journal defer` is now a compatibility adapter over the canonical Intent model: every new write records the Intent behind the legacy decision/spark pair, retries converge across entry points with digest telemetry, and keys owned by pre-conversion deferrals cannot be captured by unrelated writes (#122).
- `loaf journal context` treats unresolved deferred Intents as active truth regardless of journal recency and adds a bounded exploration-checkpoints layer with exact resume commands (#122).
- `/triage` processes the full intake queue with explicit dispositions (discard, retain, track, defer, resume, resolve, explore, shape); `/idea` narrows to pure capture; brainstorm's divergent stance now lives inside `/explore` (#122).

## [0.2.9] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Use the installed executable's packaged distribution for version reporting, upgrades, configuration maintenance, and diagnostics, preventing stale source checkouts from silently downgrading managed installations while preserving explicit source-checkout builds (#120).

## [0.2.8] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Add strict, versioned target-adapter ownership manifests with SHA-256 digests and file modes for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and Amp (#117).

### Changed

- Reconcile adapter installs, upgrades, and removals atomically and fail closed on foreign content, tampering, symlinks, path escapes, mode drift, concurrent changes, or partial failure, while preserving legacy installs that predate manifests (#117).

### Fixed

- Verify release smoke evidence before version stamping and stamp artifacts from the checked-out tag, preventing failed verification from leaving misleading release metadata (#116).

## [0.2.7] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- Add model-visible journal context at Claude Code and Codex startup and on OpenCode requests, with explicit `loaf journal context` fallbacks for unproven lifecycle modes and for Cursor and Amp (#106).
- Fingerprint Loaf-managed instruction fences independently of package versions and track shared skills by deterministic tree digest, so same-version upgrades detect content drift, preserve surrounding user prose, target symlinks, and file modes, refuse ownership conflicts or tampering, and publish shared-skill replacements through verified staging with recovery on failure (#107).
- Make root `AGENTS.md` the canonical project guidance file, preserve and back up legacy instruction content during migration, and keep `.claude/CLAUDE.md` linked to it; `loaf doctor --fix` now asks before each repair and skips non-interactively unless `--force` is supplied (#112).

### Fixed

- Prevent command text alone from creating automatic commit, pull-request, or task-completion history when the target cannot prove both success and a durable identity (#106).

## [0.2.6] - 2026-07-12

### Changed

- Shape new work through retained Change artifacts with fog-routed discovery, critique, and likelihood-of-change decomposition, and replace the generated command catalog with the compact `loaf-reference` operational guide (#97).
- Permit explicit prerelease dogfood builds while a Change lineage is incomplete, while continuing to block stable releases until its declared terminal Change lands (#103, #104).

### Added

- Add explicit project identity, atomic deferred-intent capture, active-truth continuity context, deterministic journal-search repair, and verified backup and restore workflows (#103).
- Add an opt-in, executable-pinned Codex Auto-mode policy for basic Loaf commands via `loaf install --to codex --codex-basic-commands` (#103).

### Fixed

- Keep journal logging, recent entries, and SessionStart continuity available when only the derived search index is divergent, while journal search remains fail-closed until repaired (#103).
- Converge the configured GitHub CLI account automatically before guarded commands instead of blocking the command needed to switch accounts (#99).

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Enforce configured GitHub account (357ebcbc)

### Fixed
- Generate audit-safe Homebrew formula (b1392bca)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added the shape-first hybrid Change workflow pilot: `loaf change init`, `loaf change check`, executable Change-package gates, reusable Change/PR templates, PR-template guidance, generated CLI reference updates, and distributed target artifacts for the new workflow (#91) (8a10c0d8).
- Added the first self-contained Change packages under `docs/changes/`, including the shape-first pilot and hook-provenance scoping work, so dogfooding changes carry their contract, decisions, verification plan, and research evidence in the branch diff (#91, #92) (8a10c0d8, 6ce08acc).

### Fixed

- Scoped `render-drift` and `ephemeral-provenance` hook checks to real Bash `git push` hook contexts while preserving manual `loaf check --hook ...` behavior, removing noisy non-push interruptions during normal tool use (#92) (6ce08acc).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Honor advisory hook contract and scope release checks to release-flow pushes (#89) (f5c1d56d)
- Bootstrap identical worktree agents state (#90) (7c9c298c)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- **Breaking: the session entity is gone; the project journal is now the only session-related structure (SPEC-056).** Journal entries are project-scoped events tagged with an opaque `harness_session_id`, with no session lifecycle, statuses, or rotation — so concurrent conversations across branches, worktrees, and harnesses are conflict-free by construction. `wrap` becomes an optional checkpoint entry written only when a conversation holds synthesis worth saving; nothing is ever "unwrapped." Continuity is a derived, ephemeral digest (latest wrap + recent branch entries + open tasks) emitted at conversation start and never persisted.
- Converged the strategic docs with the journal-first model and recorded the decision as ADR-019; ADR-007/010/013/016/017 carry amendment clarifiers, and the superseded SPEC-048/SPEC-049 are archived.

### Added

- **`loaf journal` command namespace** — `log`, `recent`, `search`, `show`, `context`, and `export`. `loaf journal context` emits the layered continuity digest; `loaf journal export` renders the project journal to Markdown or JSONL (SQLite stays canonical).
- **`loaf state migrate journal-first` (alias `loaf migrate journal-first`)** — an explicit, opt-in `--dry-run`/`--apply` migration that transforms the global database to the journal-first model: backfills `harness_session_id` onto journal rows, purges lifecycle-noise entries, drops the `sessions` and `session_state_snapshots` tables, and rebuilds journal search. A pre-migration database backup is mandatory, and the step is excluded from automatic apply on database open.

### Removed

- **The entire `loaf session` command namespace, including `loaf session enrich`, with no compatibility alias** — `loaf session <anything>` now resolves to an unknown command. The SessionEnd hook and the `session` journal entry type are removed; hooks no longer write start/stop marker entries, and the SessionStart hook emits the derived continuity digest instead of mutating a session record.

### Fixed

- Honor `blocking: false` end-to-end for git-workflow guard hooks: `loaf check` gains an `--advisory` flag (surface findings, exit 0), and the Claude Code and Cursor hook generators wire it into `validate-push`/`workflow-pre-pr`, so advisory hooks warn instead of hard-blocking `git push`/`gh pr create`, including direct-main source-push and build findings.
- Scope `validate-push` version-bump and CHANGELOG release-readiness checks to release-flow pushes (default branch or tag pushes). Feature-branch pushes are no longer blocked between releases under numbered pre-release versioning; the build check still runs for every push but is advisory in generated git-push hook wiring.
- Generate a valid `loaf check --hook ephemeral-provenance` command in Claude Code and Cursor hook wiring instead of the broken `bash …/hooks/.` produced when the hook was missing from the binary-path maps.
- Treat command-authored relationship provenance as valid in `loaf state doctor`, avoiding a misleading `relationship-origin-unknown` repair prompt for rows created by current Loaf commands.
- Stop `loaf release --dry-run` after reporting that no unreleased changes exist, instead of generating a bogus next-version release plan.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Added build metadata (short git commit + UTC build timestamp) to `loaf --version` / `loaf version`, injected at link time via `-ldflags "-X main.buildCommit=... -X main.buildDate=..."` and wired into the release workflow. The semver identifier is unchanged; build info renders as `loaf <version> (built <date> · git <commit>)` only on release builds, while plain `go build`, `go run`, and `go test` keep the clean `loaf <version>` line (TASK-21).
- Added `loaf spec new` — the sanctioned SQLite-native spec-create path (mirrors `loaf report create`): `<slug> --title [--id SPEC-NNN] [--source] [--body-file|--body -|--message]`, id auto-allocation across SQLite rows and on-disk specs, and `has_body` in `loaf spec show`. New specs are authored in SQLite and rendered to git via `loaf spec finalize`, so authoring never trips the `artifact-body-write` gate (SPEC-055 Track 1).
- Added `loaf spec new --branch <name> --related <SPEC-A,SPEC-B>` to record a spec's branch and related-spec links; `branch`, `source`, and resolved `related` specs are now queryable via `loaf spec show` (stored in SQLite — branch/source as columns, related as `related_to` relationships; durable-render contract unchanged). The `loaf spec show` file-path label is renamed `source:`→`render:` to disambiguate from the new provenance `source`.
- Added `loaf spec status <ref> <new-status>` — set/transition a spec's lifecycle status (validates the canonical vocabulary, writes a `status_changed` event), closing the gap where specs could not move `draft→implementing→complete` via CLI.
- Added guarded `loaf spec delete <ref> [--yes]` and `loaf project delete <project-id> [--yes]` — cascade-deleting removal for global-DB entities (refuse without `--yes`, print what was removed, leave finalized git renders in place).
- Added a `LOAF_DB` env override for the global SQLite database path so dev/smoke runs can isolate from production state (documented in `.agents/AGENTS.md`).
- Added a CI gate that runs `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` and `govulncheck` (closes the unproven half of SPEC-043's CGO-free + vulnerability-scan condition).
- Added an N-writer journal concurrency stress test proving no journal writes are dropped under contention (SPEC-043 concurrency condition).
- Added a two-`$XDG_DATA_HOME` byte-identical durable-render test (SPEC-044 acceptance condition).

### Fixed

- Corrected the stale `config/targets.yaml` amp target comment to reflect that Amp is a first-class target emitting skills plus an auto-generated TypeScript runtime plugin, not an experimental skills-only target.
- Aligned SPEC-049 frontmatter status to `complete`, matching sibling specs and the canonical spec lifecycle vocabulary.
- Renumbered the duplicate `ADR-017` install-convention decision to `ADR-018` and listed it in the decisions README.
- Corrected ADR-017 to record that ADRs and knowledge live under `docs/`, not `.agents/`, fixing an ADR-013 factual error.
- Made `migrate markdown --remove-source` atomic: it now byte-verifies the entire ephemeral set before deleting any file, so a later-file mismatch leaves earlier files intact (SPEC-045 "deletes nothing on failure" invariant for the reusable primitive).

## [0.1.53] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Added checksum-verified `loaf state restore-ephemerals` and `loaf state verify-ephemerals` rollback commands for the ephemeral Markdown cutover.
- Added `loaf check --hook ephemeral-provenance` to block tracked or dangling `.agents` task/session/idea/draft Markdown after cutover.

### Changed

- Made ephemeral agent artifacts SQLite-only by removing tracked `.agents` tasks, sessions, ideas, drafts, brainstorms, and `.agents/TASKS.json` from git after the migration gate.
- Changed `loaf session enrich` to record native SQLite journal checkpoints instead of recreating or editing session Markdown.

## [0.1.52] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Added SPEC-052 install-destination parity for Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and Amp, including a documented `~/.agents/skills` capability table and install records for relocated targets.
- Added the SPEC-049 reversible `loaf state migrate lifecycle-statuses` migration with copy-run dry-run, live-backup apply, rollback manifest, and top-level `loaf migrate lifecycle-statuses` alias.
- Added the SPEC-049 canonical lifecycle status registry for Loaf state entities, including per-entity validators and explicit exclusions for finding and run domain vocabularies.

### Changed

- SPEC-052 updates `loaf install` to write OpenCode and Amp skills to the shared `~/.agents/skills` convention, preserve foreign shared skills, and relocate old Loaf-owned per-harness skill homes through the SPEC-053 upgrade manifest.
- Trimmed duplicated skill guidance and stale references in SPEC-050, including orchestration authority handoffs, ADR-source de-duplication, helper-script contract checks, and generated CLI/session reference coverage.
- Refreshed the SPEC-051 skill routing eval harness and description rewrite validation scaffolding, including dry-run suite checks and conflict-pair probes for measured routing work.
- SPEC-049 lifecycle write paths now emit canonical statuses such as `done`, `paused`, and `in_progress` while tolerating legacy current rows until migration.
- SPEC-049 lifecycle list, show, export, and help surfaces now display canonical statuses while accepting legacy status filters during the migration window.
- SPEC-049 generated CLI reference output and report templates now document canonical lifecycle statuses, including report `done` and the lifecycle-status migration command.

## [0.1.51] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Added the SPEC-054 rich artifact entity model for reports, findings, verdicts, and provenance runs, including row-shaped JSON imports and multi-format finding exports.
- Added SPEC-046 docs Tier-2 indexing and cross-project search, including `loaf docs index`, docs search locators, stale-index refresh, and branch-aware docs results.
- Added deterministic durable document rendering and finalization in SPEC-044, including scratch/final render commands, self-consistency drift checks, and CI/build drift validation.
- Added SQLite-native artifact bodies and Tier-1 FTS search in SPEC-043, including artifact body schema, dual-source Markdown fallback, body write verbs, direct-write guardrails, and generated CLI reference coverage.

### Changed

- Completed SPEC-047 build integrity and parity hardening, including real JS/TS output validation, first-class Amp TypeScript plugin output, Gemini target removal, Codex hook semantics, OpenCode command reachability, and cross-harness parity linting.
- Converged session workflow guidance in SPEC-048 around SQLite-backed session state, native session journal commands, and render-on-demand Markdown artifacts across skills, templates, agents, and generated targets.
- SPEC-053 adds the breaking-change migration mechanism: `loaf install --upgrade` now reports externalized vendor skills and requires `--yes` before destructive deprecation cleanup, while `librarian` is available as the durable artifact handler across supported harnesses.
- SPEC-045 adds `loaf state restore-ephemerals <manifest|backup-dir|backup-id>` to restore and stage ephemeral `.agents` Markdown rollback backups with checksum verification and JSON output before destructive cutover work.
- SPEC-045 adds `loaf state verify-ephemerals <manifest|backup-dir|backup-id>` to fail closed when ephemeral `.agents` Markdown no longer matches its rollback backup bytes, creating a byte barrier for cutover CI.
- SPEC-045 adds `loaf check --hook ephemeral-provenance` to guard active specs against dangling ephemeral Markdown provenance after cutover, with ADR-017 recording the SQLite-only ephemeral artifact decision.
- SPEC-045 makes ephemeral agent artifacts SQLite-only: 422 tracked `.agents` task/session/idea/draft files and `.agents/TASKS.json` were removed from git after a rollback backup and byte barrier, with restore available through `loaf state restore-ephemerals`.
- SPEC-045 updates `loaf state doctor --json` to report whether the post-cutover ephemeral Markdown surface is clear, including explicit zero counts for legacy ephemeral Markdown files and `.agents/TASKS.json` presence.
- SPEC-045 changes `loaf session enrich <ref>` to record a native SQLite journal checkpoint linked to the requested session instead of recreating or editing session Markdown.

## [0.1.50] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Added Homebrew-ready release packaging and CI/CD so tagged Loaf releases can build native archives, upload checksummed assets, and update `levifig/homebrew-tap`.
- Completed the boring-reliable state/CLI audit, tying the single global SQLite database contract, durable project identity, repair guidance, backup/export/restore evidence, backend/Linear diagnostics, human help, and agent JSON surfaces to tests, docs, SPEC-040, native cutover guardrails, and live primary-checkout dogfood.
- State, project, repair, backup, and migration terminal help now names the JSON contract fields instead of using generic `Output JSON`, including readiness, diagnostics, repair plans, backup restore guidance, migration context, durable project identity, and applied status.
- Utility and knowledge-base help surfaces now describe `kb`, `check`, `housekeeping`, and `trace` JSON output in terms of knowledge metadata, hook results, cleanup sections/signals, traced entities, global database scope, and project identity across agent help, command help, and generated CLI reference output.
- Entity-family help surfaces now describe `brainstorm`, `idea`, `spark`, `tag`, `bundle`, and `link` JSON output in terms of global database scope, project identity, relationships, events, tags, and bundle membership across agent help, command help, and generated CLI reference output.
- `loaf session report --json` now returns the same session Markdown export contract as state/report generation aliases instead of advertising `--json` and rejecting it; session, task, spec, and report help now describe their JSON scope, project identity, diagnostics, events, and compatibility summaries precisely.
- Agent help and generated CLI reference output now describe critical state JSON contracts precisely for `state path|init|status|doctor`, guarded repairs, backups, top-level migration aliases, restore guidance, global database scope, and project identity instead of using generic raw/details wording.
- Agent help, command help, and generated CLI reference output now describe migration/report JSON contracts consistently, including state migration aliases, project context, global database paths, and report command metadata.
- `loaf state migrate storage-home --dry-run --json` now includes the durable project ID, friendly project name, and current project path when the global data-home database already contains the current project.
- `loaf report generate ... --json` success payloads now include the JSON contract version, report command, global database scope, project export scope, and durable project identity; external reports omit local database and project paths while internal session reports retain them for agent routing.
- Human missing-state errors from `loaf state backup` and Markdown `loaf state export ...` commands now include the global database scope, target database path, and safe next actions while preserving concise JSON errors for agents.
- `loaf state migrate markdown --dry-run --json` now includes the global database scope, target database path, project import scope, project name/path, and `applied: false` without creating SQLite state.
- `loaf state doctor --json` and exported state snapshots now classify local Markdown import and stale compatibility export warnings with structured category, policy, and details fields for safer agent routing.
- `loaf state export all --format json` now carries current state diagnostics and repair-plan actions alongside the raw project tables, so backend/Linear repair follow-up exports preserve the reason and policy that led to the export.
- `loaf state migrate markdown --apply|--resume --json` now includes an explicit `action` field, and human output prints the same action so agents and humans can distinguish fresh imports from resumed imports without relying on argv context.
- `loaf state backup verify --json` now includes the current checkout's restore target, preserve path, and validation commands without reading or recreating live SQLite state; human verify output prints the same concrete restore paths.
- `loaf state doctor --json` backend and Linear diagnostics now include structured `details` fields, so agents can route invalid local backend rows, drift warnings, and external sync gaps without parsing prose.
- Project-specific commands now reject invalid project path invariants before showing or mutating one identity, while `project list --json` remains available for doctor-recommended inspection.
- Project commands now reject schema checksum drift before reading identity state, matching `state doctor` invalid-state behavior and pointing users at the affected global database path.
- Project command human errors for missing SQLite state now include the global database path, scope, and safe `state status` / `state init` next actions instead of a terse missing-database message.
- `loaf project move` now accepts positional absolute paths (`loaf project move <from> [to]`) in addition to `--from/--to`, preserving the same dry-run, JSON, and path-safety checks.
- `loaf state doctor` now rejects backend mapping rows with sensitive-looking external identity values, keeping Linear/backend metadata to identifiers and URLs instead of credentials.
- `loaf state export all --json --format markdown` now returns the same machine-readable flag-conflict error as the reverse flag order instead of falling through to a generic unsupported-format message.
- `loaf report generate` now accepts its documented `--format markdown` option and supports `--json`, returning the same markdown export wrapper used by state exports with machine-readable errors for unsupported formats and missing state.
- Markdown exports from `loaf state export triage|release-readiness|spec|session` now include explicit project context; external-safe exports name the global/project scope, stable project ID, and friendly project name without exposing local paths, while internal exports also include project and database paths.
- `loaf state init|status|doctor` human output now uses the same durable project identity labels as the rest of the SQLite CLI: `project` for ID and `project name` for the friendly name.
- `loaf state backup` human output now ends with a concrete `state backup verify <backup>` next action, and backup help/reference text names the global data-home backups directory.
- `loaf state path --verbose` now provides human-oriented command, scope, project root, and database path context while preserving raw-path default output for shell substitution and restore workflows.
- `loaf project show|identity` and `loaf project list` human output now use the same command, scope, database, project ID, friendly name, and project path labels as project identity mutations.
- `loaf state migrate markdown` and `loaf state migrate storage-home` human output now report command, global database scope, project import/migration scope, database path, project context, applied status, and dry-run next actions consistently.
- `loaf project rename|move` human output now reports command, scope, database, project identity, from/to values, applied status, and dry-run next actions consistently.
- `loaf state doctor` diagnostics now label backend mapping and Linear sync findings by policy so local data fixes, drift audits, and external sync work are easier to distinguish.
- `loaf state doctor` repair-plan commands now have regression coverage proving suggested follow-up commands run in the diagnostic mode that produced them.
- `loaf state doctor` repair plans now classify local database, backend mapping, and external sync actions for clearer human and agent follow-up.
- Added safe next-action guidance to backup verification output after dogfooding the manual restore flow, so users know how to preserve the current DB, restore the verified backup, and rerun health checks.
- Documented and verified a manual SQLite backup restore flow so users can recover the global database by verifying a backup, preserving the current DB, copying the backup into place, and running health checks.
- Completed the Gate 1 control-plane evidence pass with regression coverage for project rename/move safeguards and repair dry-runs, including durable project identity, single current path, dry-run table stability, and legacy archive preview safety.
- Added command-matrix regression coverage for critical state/project/migration JSON success contracts, including read-only no-mutation checks, migration dry-run no-copy/no-database checks, and backup verification without live state access.
- Refocused the boring-reliable state/CLI plan into gated execution criteria so future work progresses through control-plane proof, recovery confidence, and UX/policy normalization instead of broad edge chasing.
- Added command-matrix regression coverage for critical state/project/migration JSON failure contracts, including contract version, command name, silent exit code, and no database creation for pre-open failures.
- Added a focused boring-reliable state/CLI plan that turns the remaining SQLite hardening work into an explicit reliability contract, command matrix, and prioritized audit tracks.
- `loaf state export all --json` is now accepted as an agent-friendly alias for `loaf state export all --format json`, while markdown export kinds continue to require explicit `--format markdown`.
- `loaf state doctor` repair plans now route invalid backend-mapping diagnostics to `loaf state doctor --json` instead of suggesting `state export`, which refuses to run while state is invalid.
- `loaf state doctor --json` now includes non-mutating repair plans whenever diagnostics are present, even without `--dry-run`, so agents receive next actions alongside health failures.
- `loaf state backup verify --json` now includes `backup_path` in verification failure payloads after a path has been parsed, making invalid-backup diagnostics easier for agents to correlate.
- `loaf state path --json` now reports the resolved global SQLite path with contract version, project root, and database scope without creating the database.
- `loaf state doctor` now accepts project-level backend mappings, allowing a Loaf project to be linked to a Linear/external project while still rejecting mismatched project mapping IDs.
- `loaf state doctor --json` now exits nonzero for invalid SQLite state while still returning the machine-readable status payload.
- `loaf state export all --format json` now includes `project_paths` rows so project-scoped snapshots preserve checkout path history alongside durable project identity.
- `npm run build` now rebuilds the Go CLI before regenerating the CLI reference so agent-facing docs do not lag behind command metadata changes.
- `loaf state backup verify <backup> [--json]` now verifies existing SQLite backups without live-state access and reports all project identities captured in the global backup.
- `loaf task refresh|sync --json` and `loaf session enrich|housekeeping --json` compatibility summaries now include `contract_version` for agentic consumers.

- `loaf state backup` JSON and human output now report the number of project identities captured in the global database backup.
- `loaf state backup` JSON and human output now identify backups as global database backups.
- `loaf project move` now rejects missing or non-directory target paths before previewing or recording a checkout move.
- `loaf state doctor` now flags backend mapping rows with empty backend, local entity, external entity, or sync-status fields.
- `loaf state repair ...` human output now shows `--dry-run` or `--apply` in the command header and suppresses apply guidance when no rows or files match.

- `loaf state backup --json` and `loaf state export all --format json` failures now return machine-readable JSON error payloads instead of plain text.
- `loaf trace --json` and `loaf idea capture --json` validation failures now return machine-readable JSON error payloads instead of plain text.
- `loaf link create|remove` now accepts the documented `--from` and `--to` flags, and `--json` validation failures return machine-readable JSON error payloads.
- `loaf --json` command paths now apply a central fallback so unwrapped validation failures still return machine-readable JSON error payloads.
- `--agent-help` and the generated `cli-reference` skill now document task mutation and compatibility `--json` options.
- `--agent-help` now has a regression guard against live help drift for documented `--json` options, and documents state/session/housekeeping JSON output options consistently.
- `loaf trace --help` now shows trace usage instead of reporting `--help` as an unknown option, and `--agent-help` documents trace JSON output.
- `loaf check --help` now shows registered hook usage instead of reporting `--help` as an unknown option.
- `loaf migrate markdown|storage-home --help` now shows top-level migration usage instead of reporting `--help` as an unknown option, and `--agent-help` documents their migration options.
- `loaf state doctor` now warns when Linear integration is enabled but active local task rows have no Linear backend mapping.
- `--agent-help` now documents state-backed brainstorm, idea, spark, tag, bundle, and link subcommands instead of exposing them as bare top-level command names.
- The generated `cli-reference` skill now documents top-level command options plus state-backed trace, brainstorm, idea, spark, tag, bundle, and link commands.

- `loaf state doctor` repair plans now deduplicate repeated repair actions while preserving distinct diagnostic causes.
- `loaf state backup` now verifies backup integrity, schema version, and project identity before returning, and reports those checks in JSON and human output.
- `loaf state backup` now verifies created backups through a read-only SQLite connection so verification does not mutate backup files or create sidecars.
- `loaf project move` now supports `--dry-run` for validated path-move previews without mutating the global project identity index.
- Project rename and move dry-runs now open SQLite read-only, avoid initializing missing databases, and `loaf project rename` supports `--dry-run` previews.

- `loaf project list` now shows registered projects from the global SQLite database with stable IDs, friendly names, current paths, and JSON output.
- Native Go is now the shipped Loaf runtime, with cross-platform binaries replacing the transitional TypeScript delegation path.
- Existing Markdown-only Loaf projects now have a documented dry-run and apply path for adopting SQLite-backed state without rewriting source artifacts.
- SQLite project identity now uses generated stable project IDs in one global database, plus friendly names and path mappings managed by `loaf project show|rename|move`.
- `agents-config` now documents and pins the fall-back-to-`projectRoot` behavior when a linked worktree's `.git` pointer file is malformed (missing `gitdir:` line or non-matching shape). This is the deliberate Case-4 fallback in `resolveEffectiveRoot` — distinct from the "main removed" case fixed in #53, which still throws. Closes a Codex review follow-up on #53.

### Fixed

- Markdown migration apply no longer requires legacy `.agents/TASKS.json` when importing Markdown-only task files.
- State-backed CLI commands now handle parent and nested `--help` consistently before parsing options or opening SQLite state.
- SQLite-backed state commands now fail on project identity mapping errors instead of silently falling back to path-derived legacy project IDs.
- Storage-home migration now preserves pending SQLite writes when copying legacy state into XDG data-home storage.
- Markdown migration relationship imports now ignore empty dependency arrays, prune stale imported links by structured origin, and record imported/manual relationship provenance.
- Storage-home migration now upgrades copied legacy databases before readiness checks and rekeys legacy path-hash project rows into generated stable identities in the global database.
- Project path moves now reject unknown source paths without creating a stray project row, and SQLite enforces one current path per project.

### Removed

- Removed the bundled TypeScript command runtime and obsolete TypeScript build/test toolchain from the shipped CLI.

## [0.1.49] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- `findActiveSessionForBranch` now applies a deterministic `filePath` tiebreaker on both the branch-match and most-recent-active fallback paths, so candidates with byte-identical effective timestamps resolve to the same session across repeated calls regardless of `readdirSync` order.

## [0.1.48] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Document Go as the accepted runtime direction for Loaf's stateful core and shape SQLite work around that runtime foundation.
- Add the initial dependency-free Go runtime skeleton for future state commands without changing the shipped TypeScript CLI.
- Add Go-native `loaf state path` dispatch with XDG-backed, hashed project-state paths shared by main and linked Git worktrees.
- Add a transitional Go-to-TypeScript legacy delegation bridge so unmigrated commands keep using the bundled CLI while `state` commands remain Go-native.
- Use a portable `bin/loaf` launcher with native runtime lookup under `bin/native/<platform>-<arch>/`, keeping legacy TypeScript delegation installable on unsupported native platforms during the Go port.
- Select `github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/driver` as the SQLite driver, with cgo-free, dependency, vulnerability, and testability guardrails documented before adding the dependency.
- Package the Go front controller as the public `loaf` command while bundling TypeScript fallback assets for delegated commands.
- Define the initial SQLite operational-state schema as Go-owned migration metadata with dependency-free guardrail tests.
- Add the approved cgo-free SQLite driver and Go-native `state init/status/doctor` storage lifecycle commands.
- Add a Go-native markdown migration dry-run that previews `.agents/` import counts, skipped files, inferred relationships, and spark entries without creating SQLite state.
- Add a Go-native markdown migration apply path that initializes SQLite and imports current `.agents/` specs, tasks, ideas, brainstorms, sessions, reports, sparks, relationships, and source provenance without mutating Markdown.
- Add a Go-native `loaf trace` read model for imported SQLite state, resolving aliases to source provenance plus inbound and outbound task/spec relationships.
- Add a Go-native `loaf task list` read path for imported SQLite state, with JSON and human output, active/status filters, dependency aliases, source provenance, and Markdown compatibility fallback.
- Add a Go-native `loaf spec list` read path for imported SQLite state, with JSON and human output, task counts, source provenance, and Markdown compatibility fallback.
- Add a Go-native `loaf session list` read path for imported SQLite state, with JSON and human output, archived-session import, journal counts, source provenance, and Markdown compatibility fallback.
- Add a Go-native `loaf report list` read path for imported SQLite state, with JSON and human output, type/status filters, archived-report import, source provenance, and Markdown compatibility fallback.
- Import explicit lineage relationships and spark promotion links into SQLite so `loaf trace` can show spark-to-idea-to-spec/task provenance from migrated `.agents/` artifacts.
- Import shaping draft artifacts into SQLite so `loaf trace` can show brainstorm-to-idea-to-shaping-draft-to-spec/task provenance from migrated `.agents/` drafts.
- Add a Go-native `loaf session log` write path for initialized SQLite state, preserving unresolved journal context as nullable fields while keeping hook-mode and Markdown-only compatibility delegation.
- Add Go-native `loaf idea list` and `loaf idea resolve ... --by ...` paths so imported ideas can be marked resolved in SQLite and stay out of the default triage list.
- Add Go-native `loaf spark list` and `loaf spark resolve ... --by ...` paths so imported sparks can be marked resolved in SQLite and stay out of the default triage list.
- Add Go-native `loaf tag list/show/add/remove` paths for SQLite-backed many-to-many classification across imported state rows and journal entries.
- Add Go-native `loaf bundle create/show/add/remove` paths for SQLite-backed related sets assembled from tag queries and explicit membership.
- Add Go-native `loaf link create/list/remove` paths for SQLite-backed explicit relationships that are visible through `loaf trace`.
- Add Go-native `loaf task update <task> --status <status>` for SQLite-backed task status changes with status-change events.
- Add Go-native `loaf task show <task>` for SQLite-backed task inspection with dependencies, source provenance, and imported body output.
- Add Go-native `loaf task create --title ...` for SQLite-backed task creation with generated aliases, spec/dependency relationships, and creation events.
- Add Go-native `loaf task update <task>` metadata updates for SQLite-backed priority, spec, dependency, and session relationship changes.
- Add Go-native `loaf spec archive <spec>` for SQLite-backed spec archival with status-change events and skipped-ref reporting.
- Add Go-native `loaf task archive` for SQLite-backed task archival by task ID or spec, with status-change events and active-list filtering.
- Add Go-native `loaf idea capture --title ...` for SQLite-backed idea creation with generated aliases, status-change events, and list/trace visibility.
- Add Go-native `loaf idea archive` for SQLite-backed idea archival with optional reason notes, status-change events, skipped-ref reporting, and default triage-list filtering.
- Record optional `loaf spark resolve --reason` rationale on SQLite-backed spark resolution relationships and status-change events.
- Add Go-native `loaf spark capture --scope ... --text ...` for SQLite-backed spark creation with generated aliases, status-change events, and list/trace visibility.
- Add Go-native `loaf spark promote --to-idea ...` for SQLite-backed spark-to-idea promotion relationships visible through trace and link reads.
- Add Go-native `loaf idea show` for SQLite-backed idea inspection with source provenance, imported body output, and immediate relationships.
- Add Go-native `loaf idea promote --to-spec ...` for SQLite-backed idea-to-spec promotion relationships visible through trace, link, and idea-show reads.
- Add Go-native `loaf brainstorm list` for SQLite-backed brainstorm triage reads with status filters and source provenance.
- Add Go-native `loaf brainstorm show` for SQLite-backed brainstorm inspection with source provenance, imported body output, and immediate relationships.
- Add Go-native `loaf brainstorm promote --to-idea ...` for SQLite-backed brainstorm-to-idea promotion relationships visible through trace, link, and brainstorm-show reads.
- Add Go-native `loaf brainstorm archive` for SQLite-backed brainstorm archival with optional reason notes, status-change events, and default triage-list filtering.
- Add Go-native `loaf state backup` for repository-external SQLite database backups with JSON and human output.
- Add Go-native `loaf state export all --format json` for internal SQLite state snapshots.
- Add Go-native `loaf state export triage --format markdown` for external-safe SQLite triage summaries.
- Add command-level linked-worktree coverage proving Go-native SQLite state commands share the same project database.
- Add `loaf state doctor` diagnostics for schema mismatch, migration checksum drift, and stale generated export records.
- Add state-init safety coverage proving SQLite state is repository-external and schema columns avoid secret storage.
- Add public binary bridge coverage proving one packaged `loaf` command can run Go-native state commands and delegate unmigrated commands to the TypeScript fallback.
- Add public CLI dry-run coverage proving markdown migration previews all required counts and leaves SQLite state uncreated.
- Add SQLite secret-boundary coverage proving backend mappings store only external identity metadata and native state code does not introduce token or credential storage.
- Harden Go artifact verification so release builds compare the launcher, platform native runtime, plugin mirror, and TypeScript fallback layout.

### Fixed

- Return clear SQLite initialization errors for Go-only commands in Markdown-only projects instead of delegating to missing TypeScript commands.
- Resolve installed TypeScript fallback assets from the namespaced `~/.local/share/loaf/dist-cli` layout used by `loaf install`.
- Keep SQLite writes transactional for tag creation and apply per-connection SQLite pragmas for foreign keys, WAL journaling, and busy timeout handling.

## [0.1.47] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Branch-fallback session routing no longer rewrites the adopted session's `branch:` frontmatter. Previously, every `loaf session log` against a branch with no dedicated session would overwrite the resolved session's origin branch, breaking subsequent routing. The session's origin is now preserved across every adoption.
- Multi-worktree branch routing now resolves correctly. When several sessions are active simultaneously (orchestrator on one branch, agents on others) and the current branch has no dedicated session, `loaf session log` adopts the most-recently-updated active session instead of dropping the entry. Previous behavior only fell back when exactly one active session existed.
- Branch-fallback WARN now names the resolved session file and its origin branch (e.g., `WARN: no session for branch 'release/v0.16.0'; logging to most-recent active session '20260101-120000-session.md' (origin branch 'cwt/foo'). Pass --session-id <id> to silence.`), so misroutes are visible at a glance. A distinct WARN fires when no active session exists to fall back to.
- Branch-fallback WARN now distinguishes rename-link adoption (`WARN: branch '<new>' appears to be a rename of '<old>'; logging to its session ...`) from most-recent-active adoption, so operators can tell why a log landed where it did instead of seeing the inaccurate "most-recent active" wording on every adoption.

## [0.1.46] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Adopt Common Changelog as Loaf's changelog writing standard ([Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/))
- Let council workflows state the selected composition and spawn directly, while still reserving the final decision for the user

### Fixed

- `.agents/loaf.json` reads and writes from a linked git worktree now follow the SPEC-036 centralization to the main worktree, so `loaf release --pre-merge` (and other consumers of `loaf.json`) no longer fail with "No version files found" when invoked from a migrated linked worktree.
- `agents-config` now throws an actionable error (instead of silently writing a stale shadow config) when a linked worktree's recorded main has been removed, mirroring the diagnostic surfaced by `loaf migrate worktree-storage`.
- `workflow-pre-pr` no longer treats backtick-quoted `## [Unreleased]` mentions in CHANGELOG prose as the real section header, so PRs whose intro text references the staging area no longer false-block with "empty Unreleased section".

## [0.1.45] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- `loaf release` refreshes uv-managed Python release artifacts with package-local `uv sync`, and refuses to commit unignored `.venv` files created during release artifact refresh.

## [0.1.44] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Add dedicated handoff skill (b9a97b51)

## [0.1.43] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- `loaf task list --status <status>` filters task output by lifecycle state.

### Changed

- `loaf release --post-merge` now validates release readiness from version files and `CHANGELOG.md`, so conventional squash subjects like `feat:` and `fix:` are accepted.
- Release workflow guidance now calls out post-bump build-artifact verification and stricter changelog curation before publishing.

### Fixed

- `loaf migrate worktree-storage` treats identical file contents as already resolved before considering mtimes or overwrite conflicts.
- Worktree migration diagnostics now surface directory-read failures under `LOAF_DEBUG_RESOLVE`, and migration output respects `NO_COLOR` and non-TTY output.
- Release tags are created with explicit signed-tag mode.
- Task index rebuild and frontmatter sync preserve valid concurrent entries and unknown spec metadata.
- Task and session lock staleness detection share one PID/host-aware policy, avoiding false eviction of live same-host lock holders.
- Linked-worktree migration refusal preserves unknown-command feedback while still nudging users toward `loaf migrate worktree-storage`.

## [0.1.42] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **Worktree-aware `.agents/` storage.** Loaf now treats `.agents/` as project-scoped state rather than branch-scoped content. Running any `loaf` command from a linked git worktree (a `git worktree add`-style checkout) resolves `.agents/` to the **main worktree's directory** instead of the worktree's own copy. Sessions, IDs, knowledge, and ideas converge across all worktrees of a project. Single-checkout repositories see no behavior change. See [ADR-013](docs/decisions/ADR-013-agentic-state-storage-model.md) for the decision rationale and rejected alternatives.
- **`loaf migrate worktree-storage`.** New command that moves a linked worktree's local `.agents/` content into the main worktree's `.agents/`. Dry-run by default; `--apply` performs the move. Conflict policy prefers the most-recently-modified version when a file exists in both locations, with `--force-from-worktree` and `--force-from-main` overrides. Writes a `.moved-to` back-pointer in the source location and is idempotent on re-run. EXDEV (cross-filesystem) moves fall back to `fs.cpSync` with `preserveTimestamps`.
- **Pre-A3 refusal nudge.** Loaf invocations in a linked worktree with un-migrated content are refused with exit code `2` and a single-action instruction: run `loaf migrate worktree-storage`. The migrate command itself, `help` / `-h` / `--help`, and `-v` / `--version` are always allowed; single-checkout repositories and the main worktree never trigger the refusal.
- **`LOAF_DEBUG_RESOLVE` environment variable.** When set to `1` / `true` / `yes` / `on` (case-insensitive), surfaces git probe diagnostics from `findAgentsDir` that are otherwise suppressed. Useful for diagnosing unexpected refusal nudge fires.

### Changed

- **Retired convention: "spec on main, tasks+code on branch".** Under the worktree-aware storage model, `.agents/` content always lives in the main worktree's directory regardless of which branch's PR is in flight. PR templates and project docs that referenced this convention should be updated.

### Migration

Users with active `git worktree add` linked worktrees containing `.agents/` content must run `loaf migrate worktree-storage --apply` once after upgrading. Single-checkout repositories require no action.

## [0.1.40] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- `git-workflow` skill — new "Changelog Discipline" section in `references/commits.md`. Codifies the rule that user-facing CHANGELOG entries describe what changed from a user/operator's perspective, not how the work was tracked or organized internally. Drops internal terms (spec/task IDs, internal session references, hook IDs that aren't user-facing); keeps references to public artifacts (`ADR-NNN`, public CLI flags, documented file paths); requires curating auto-generated `loaf release --pre-merge` output before bumping.

## [0.1.39] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- ADR lifecycle now supports `Rejected` as a fifth status. Full lifecycle: `Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded`. A `Rejected` ADR records "the team weighed this option and explicitly chose against it" — useful when the same idea resurfaces.

### Changed

- `architecture` skill — Lifecycle section codifies body-section requirements by status. `## Deprecated` is required for `Deprecated`, `## Rejected` is required for `Rejected`, `## Superseded` is optional for `Superseded` (the `superseded_by:` linkage suffices).
- ADR frontmatter schema finalized as structured what+when: `status`, `date`, `accepted_date` (optional), `rejected_date`, `deprecated_date`, `supersedes`, `superseded_by`. The `deprecated_reason` and `migrated_to` fields introduced during the previous deprecation pass are dropped — context belongs in the body section's prose, not duplicated in frontmatter.
- ADR template (`content/templates/adr.md`) updated with the new schema and a header note that `Rejected` and `Deprecated` ADRs require a body section.
- `ADR-004`, `ADR-006`, `ADR-009` frontmatter cleaned up to match the new schema; body sections preserve all migration content.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Operating Principles section gains two new subsections:
  - **Adversarial Review for Substantive Guidance Changes** — `loaf:reviewer` is the baseline (internal-consistency auditor); `codex:rescue` or equivalent adversarial reviewer is recommended when available, since the two readers catch different defect classes. Codex is plugin-dependent and optional.
  - **Recategorization as a General Lifecycle Pattern** — distinguishes supersession (the answer changed; new artifact replaces old) from recategorization (the artifact's classification was wrong; the underlying rule still holds; deprecate-in-place and point to new home). Generalizes beyond ADRs.

## [0.1.38] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- `architecture` skill — tightened bar. ADRs are now reserved for architecturally significant decisions (those affecting the system's structure, key quality attributes, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques) OR decisions that are difficult to reverse, per Microsoft Well-Architected canonical phrasing. The skill includes a structured Triage Gate that operationalizes the bar with explicit routing for non-ADR decisions to `/shape` (SPEC), `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `VISION.md`, the owning skill's docs, or session-log.
- `architecture` skill — "decisions are choices" filter. ADRs require at least one credible alternative considered. Catches principle/manifesto-shaped artifacts at write time and routes them to `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `VISION.md` instead.
- `architecture` skill — cost-of-divergence framing. The skill evaluates decisions by the consequence of casual divergence (now: security regression, contract or interface break, multi-PR coordination; later: foundational shape commitments whose future reversal cost is the reason to record now) rather than by the cost of change alone. Captures security-boundary decisions reversible-by-code and foundational early-project commitments.
- `architecture` skill — Lifecycle nuance. Original `Decision`/`Context`/`Rationale`/`Consequences` sections are immutable post-acceptance; status transitions, frontmatter additions, and append-only `## Deprecated` / `## Superseded` sections are the supported lifecycle mechanism. Distinguishes recategorization (deprecate-in-place, content moved elsewhere) from supersession (new ADR replaces old, both linked).
- `architecture` skill — maturity-aware bar. The bar is constant; the number of decisions clearing it scales with project maturity. Early/exploratory phases pass foundational shape commitments via the cost-of-divergence framing's "later" prong.
- ADR template (`content/templates/adr.md`) — HTML-comment header surfaces the bar to agents reading the template; propagates to the `reflect` skill's shared template via the build system.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — new Operating Principles section, with the `Authorship Model — Agents Create, Humans Curate` subsection as its first principle.
- `docs/knowledge/knowledge-management-design.md` — new Naming Conventions section.
- `docs/decisions/README.md` — index updated; missing ADR-012 row added.

### Deprecated

- ADR-004 (Knowledge Naming Convention) — recategorized as a project naming convention. Active source: `docs/knowledge/knowledge-management-design.md` Naming Conventions section.
- ADR-006 (Agent-Creates, Human-Curates Model) — recategorized as a guiding principle (philosophical/operational rationale, not architectural). Active source: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Operating Principles section.
- ADR-009 (Sparks Convention in Brainstorm Documents) — recategorized as workflow lore for the `brainstorm` skill. Owning skill is the canonical source.

## [0.1.37] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- `/refactor-deepen` skill — surfaces refactoring opportunities through a deepening lens (modules that hide complexity behind narrow interfaces). Vocabulary discipline is load-bearing: the skill uses an eight-term taxonomy (Module, Interface, Implementation, Depth, Seam, Adapter, Leverage, Locality) ported verbatim from Matt Pocock's `improve-codebase-architecture` skill, with `references/language.md`, `references/deepening.md`, and `references/interface-design.md` providing the vocabulary's full semantics. Default INTERFACE-DESIGN phase spawns 3 sub-agents with identical briefs (no opposing-constraint priming) — variety emerges from sampling, not manufactured opposition. Terminates by writing a PLAN file. Not for renames, extractions, or generic restructuring (use `/loaf:implement`).
- `loaf kb glossary` CLI subcommand with five verbs: `upsert` writes or updates a canonical term; `check` resolves a term to canonical, avoided-alias, or unknown; `list` enumerates entries (one line per term, scriptable); `stabilize` promotes a candidate to canonical; `propose` writes a candidate (low-commitment, exploratory). Mutation policy lives in the verb names themselves rather than skill prose. Write commands (`upsert`, `stabilize`, `propose`) fail fast in Linear-native mode with the exact spec error verbatim; read commands (`list`, `check`) work in both modes.
- Domain glossary KB convention at `docs/knowledge/glossary.md` with `type: glossary` frontmatter and four sections: `## Canonical Terms`, `## Candidates`, `## Relationships`, `## Flagged ambiguities`. Lazy creation — the file is written only on the first successful `upsert`/`stabilize`/`propose`, never on `check` or `list`.
- `content/templates/grilling.md` shared interview-protocol template covering the relentless-interview / decision-tree / recommend-per-question / explore-when-answerable mechanics. Distributed by `targets.yaml` to `architecture` and `refactor-deepen` skills (NOT `shape` — deferred per separate idea). Mutation policy is delegated to the consuming skill; this template defines interview shape only.
- Plan artifact convention at `.agents/plans/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<slug>.md`. Plans use temporal-record naming (same family as sessions, ideas, drafts, councils) — write-once snapshots of a `/refactor-deepen` interview, never updated. No `id` frontmatter field; the filename is the identity.

### Changed

- `/architecture` skill evolved to integrate with the glossary: reads existing glossary at interview start, challenges drifted/fuzzy language inline, offers `loaf kb glossary upsert` or `stabilize` when load-bearing terms surface during ADR interviews. Glossary side-effects are additive — never gating ADR creation. The `templates/adr.md` artifact format is preserved byte-identical.
- `cli/lib/kb/glossary.ts` parser is fence-aware and strict: tracks ``` and `~~~` code-fence state so heading-like content inside fences is preserved verbatim; rejects files missing required sections; rejects preamble prose before the first `## ` header; lossless parse/serialize round-trip on any accepted input.

### Internal

- 96 new tests in `cli/lib/kb/glossary.test.ts` and `cli/commands/kb-glossary.test.ts` covering lossless round-trip, fence handling (backtick + tilde), Linear-native gating in all three write verbs, and read-time-no-creation regressions.

## [0.1.36] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- Validate flags early in release and let dry-run preview when no commits (4083f362)

## [0.1.35] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Add artifact journal entry types (TASK-103) (9443c355)

## [0.1.34] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Pre-commit `validate-commit` guard against bundled build-artifact leakage. Detects when staged paths include `plugins/`, `dist/`, `.claude-plugin/`, or root lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`, `bun.lockb`) on commits whose subject does not indicate a build/release/deps/lockfile scope. Block message names the offending paths and shows the exact `git reset` + split-commit recipe. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify` when intentional.

### Changed

- `loaf release` now runs the project's full build script (`npm run build` for Node projects with a `build` script in `package.json`) instead of the content-only `loaf build`. Refreshes the bundled CLI (`plugins/loaf/bin/loaf`) so the version baked into the bundle matches the version in `package.json` after a release commit. Falls back to `loaf build` for non-Node projects.

### Fixed

- `extractUnreleasedEntries` (renamed to `extractUnreleasedBody`) preserves curated `[Unreleased]` body verbatim — including `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Removed`, `### Fixed`, `### Internal` subsection headers — under the new versioned section. Previously filtered to list-item lines only, flattening the categorical structure. Caught when the comprehensive 6-section CHANGELOG drafted for v0.1.33 was reduced to a single bulleted list.

## [0.1.33] - 2026-04-30

- `loaf release --pre-merge` flag bundling `--no-tag --no-gh --base <auto-detected>` with 4-step base detection (explicit `--base` → open-PR base via `gh pr view` → `git config loaf.release.base` → default branch).
- `loaf release --post-merge` flag with 8-point guardrail checklist that finalizes a release after squash-merge: tag → push tag → GH release from CHANGELOG section → pull base → best-effort feature-branch cleanup. Light idempotency: each guardrail is rerun-safe; partial-failure aborts produce actionable manual-fix messages naming the exact recovery command.
- `loaf release --version-file <path>` repeatable CLI flag for ad-hoc version-file selection, complementing declared `release.versionFiles` in `.agents/loaf.json` for monorepo layouts (e.g., `["backend/pyproject.toml", "frontend/package.json"]`).
- Release-only PR classifier in `workflow-pre-pr`: a PR whose diff is exactly version-file paths + `CHANGELOG.md` with a non-empty `## [<version>]` section bypasses the empty-`[Unreleased]` block. Enables release-only PRs on repos with protected default branches.
- `loaf release` commit subject is now `chore: release v<semver>` (was `release: vX.Y.Z`). Conventional-Commits compliant; passes `@commitlint/config-conventional` without rewording. `workflow-pre-pr` and `validate-push` accept the new shape as a pre-merge escape hatch (shape-validated, not prefix-only — `chore: release notes draft` is still rejected).
- `loaf release` preserves curated `[Unreleased]` entries when present: existing list items are copied verbatim under the new `## [X.Y.Z]` header and auto-generation does not run. Resolves the recurring overwrite/jargon friction observed in 0.1.31 and 0.1.32.
- `loaf release` re-inserts the `- _No unreleased changes yet._` stub under fresh `[Unreleased]` after each release, so subsequent `gh pr create` does not block on an "empty" section.
- `/loaf:release` skill collapses Step 4 to `loaf release --pre-merge --bump <type> --yes` and Step 6 to `loaf release --post-merge`. Replaces the prior manual `git tag` / `git push --tags` / `gh release create` / `git checkout` / `git pull` / `git branch -d` sequence.
- CI `Build Distributions` workflow now verifies build-artifact freshness instead of auto-committing to `main`. Fails loudly when `dist/`, `plugins/`, or `.claude-plugin/` are out of sync with source. Also runs on `pull_request` so drift is caught during PR review, not only after merge. Removes the `GH013` auto-push rejection that had been failing every push to `main`.
- `release` from the accepted Conventional Commits types in `validate-commit` (Loaf-specific extension; not commitlint-compatible). The `chore: release v<semver>` shape replaces it cleanly.
- Orphan `content/hooks/pre-tool/workflow-pre-pr.sh` — no longer wired; `loaf check --hook workflow-pre-pr` auto-dispatches to the TS path.
- `loaf check workflow-pre-pr`: empty-section detector under `[Unreleased]` now mirrors `extractUnreleasedEntries` and discards the `- _No unreleased changes yet._` stub before checking for curated entries. Previously, the stub (a markdown list item by design) was counted as a real entry, which would have allowed feature PRs that forget to add changelog entries to silently pass.
- Unified base-branch resolver via `skipPRLookup?` option in `cli/lib/release/base.ts`. Replaces the divergent `resolveBaseForPostMerge` that had drifted into `post-merge.ts`. One resolver now serves `--pre-merge`, `--post-merge` (skips PR tier — the PR is closed/merged at that point), and the release-only PR classifier.
- Regression coverage added across the spec: `validate-commit` AI-attribution path-token pass cases + structured-attribution reject cases, `loaf release` end-to-end commit subject assertion (real commit, not `--dry-run`), post-merge guardrails 4/5/7/8 + idempotency rerun, base-detection 4-step precedence, monorepo declared-file resolution, release-only PR classifier mixed-diff disqualification.

## [0.1.32] - 2026-04-29

Note: An earlier iteration of this release explored a configurable soul catalog with a `loaf soul` CLI; that work was reviewed in-flight and pivoted away from before merge — the lore decoupling stands, the soul layer does not. See the SPEC-033 archive for the full exploration.

### Changed
- Agent profile prompts (`implementer`, `reviewer`, `researcher`, `librarian`) describe themselves functionally — no Warden/Fellowship lore in profile bodies.
- Council references and skill prose now use profile types (`implementer`/`reviewer`/`researcher`/`librarian`/`orchestrator`); fellowship vocabulary is stripped from agent-facing skill content.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/knowledge/skill-architecture.md` reframed around the two-layer model: profiles for mechanics, skills for knowledge.

### Removed
- The deprecated `content/templates/soul.md` template.

## [0.1.31] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- `--session-id <id>` flag on `loaf session log`, `loaf session archive`, and `loaf session enrich` for explicit session targeting independent of git branch.

### Fixed
- Session journal misrouting: `loaf session log` now routes by `claude_session_id` first, then hook stdin payload, then branch fallback. Resolves silent corruption observed during the v0.1.30 release where post-merge wrap entries landed in stopped sessions instead of the active one.
- `loaf session log --from-hook --session-id <id>` with empty stdin now honors the explicit `--session-id` override instead of silently no-opping.

### Changed
- Branch-fallback session routing emits a stderr warning so misroutes are visible instead of silent. Pass `--session-id` to silence the warning.

### Internal
- Session lookup helpers extracted to a new `cli/lib/session/` module (`store.ts` for persistence primitives, `find.ts` for finders, `resolve.ts` for the 3-tier resolution chain).

## [0.1.30] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Escape regex literals in opencode runtime plugin (b9357605)
- Post-ADR-010 doctor + version followups (7ef8ab1b)

## [0.1.29] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Linear-native routing in implement skill (parent + sub-issue) (1c12a442)
- Mode-aware linear reconciliation checks in housekeeping (ae130564)
- Linear-native mode in breakdown skill (parent + sub-issues) (2ad67e30)

## [0.1.28] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Enforce project symlinks and migrate user content on loaf install (0abf44bd)
- Add loaf doctor command for alignment checks (23b787e0)

### Changed
- Remap fenced-section targets to canonical .agents/AGENTS.md (4ff26006)

### Fixed
- Isolate check.test.ts fixtures and serialize vitest file runs (89f62d5d)

## [0.1.27] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- `loaf session enrich` CLI command — reviews JSONL conversation logs via librarian agent, fills in missing journal entries (decisions, discoveries, context)
- JSONL extractor module (`cli/lib/journal/extractor.ts`) — filters conversation logs, discovers subagent transcripts, enforces 100KB summary cap
- `LOAF_ENRICHMENT` hook isolation — prevents enrichment agent from creating spurious session files
- Wrap skill Step 0: enrichment before wrap-up generation
- Housekeeping enrichment pass for stopped/done sessions + `.agents/tmp/` cleanup

### Changed
- Session status `complete` renamed to `done`, `paused` removed (stopped covers it)
- Session statuses: `active | stopped | done | blocked | archived`

## [0.1.26] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- `loaf session housekeeping` command — orphan detection, split consolidation, age-based archival, spec linkage repair
- `.loaf-state` trigger mechanism — `SessionEnd` flags housekeeping due, `SessionStart` surfaces nudge
- `/wrap` skill — interactive+scripted session close with `loaf session end --wrap`
- `loaf session context for-compact` — PreCompact journal flush + nudge instructions (replaces `compact.sh`)
- `loaf session context for-resumption` — PostCompact rich resumption context
- Librarian agent profile — Ent lore, behavioral contract, `Read + Edit (.agents/)` tool scope
- `TaskCompleted` session hook — auto-logs task completions to session journal
- `UserPromptSubmit` hook — injects Implementation Principles on every prompt
- `claude_session_id`-first session lookup with split consolidation on start

### Changed
- All hooks moved from `plugin.json` to `hooks/hooks.json` (`plugin.json` silently drops non-matcher events)
- Absorb `context-archiver` agent into Librarian profile (decisions persist to spec changelog)
- Journal `PostToolUse` hooks consolidated: `git commit` + `gh pr` (specific `if` conditions)
- `UserPromptSubmit` hook uses `type: command` (not `type: prompt` — prompt type acts as gate/validator)
- Implementation Principles: question-guard, task-before-tool rule
- Journal Discipline: git events auto-logged by hooks, manual logging removed
- Release skill: `/wrap` runs after version bump, `AskUserQuestion` for all decisions, `/reflect` always post-merge

### Fixed
- `TaskCompleted` hook handler — uses `hook_event_name` (not `tool_name`), logs `task_description` for richer context
- `claude_session_id` priority over branch for session lookup
- `appendEntry` blank line handling after `session(stop)` markers

## [0.1.24] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- Release skill: tags and GH Releases now created post-merge on `main` instead of pre-merge on feature branch, fixing dangling tag references after squash merge
- Release skill: housekeeping step orchestrates `/wrap`, `/reflect`, and archive instead of just verifying they were done
- Session state: Stop hook changed from CLI command (`loaf session state update`) to agent-written prompt hook — drops redundant journal rehash, writes contextual summary
- Implement skill: description updated to cover all implementation work, not just multi-file tasks

### Added
- `implement-routing` PreToolUse prompt hook on `Edit|Write` — auto-activates `/implement` for implementation work
- `getUncommittedCount()` helper for session state display at startup

### Fixed
- Report and session tests use isolated temp directories (`mkdtempSync` + `realpathSync`) to eliminate flaky failures from cross-file interference in parallel vitest runs
- Session test timeout increased to 15s to accommodate temp directory operations

## [0.1.23] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- `/wrap` skill writes Session Wrap-Up report into session file above `## Current State` for archival persistence
- Release skill verifies `/wrap` and `/reflect` were run before merge (wrap required, reflect advisory)
- `/clear` session continuity — `SessionEnd(reason=clear)` logs `session(clear)` marker and keeps session active; `SessionStart(source=clear)` resumes existing session file with new `claude_session_id`
- `## Current State` section in session files, mechanically updated on every Stop event with branch, commit, activity summary, and last 5 journal entries
- Stop hook (`session-state-update`) to trigger Current State updates after each model turn
- Session ID tracking in `session(start)` and `session(resume)` journal entries: `(session {short_id})`
- Current State surfaced in SessionStart output on resume for immediate context recovery
- `source` and `reason` fields in `HookInput` for lifecycle event discrimination
- `clear` entry type in session journal vocabulary

### Removed
- Dead `isNewConversation` variable in session start logic (set but never read)

## [0.1.22] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Journal-nudge hook moved from Stop event to PostToolUse(Agent|WebFetch|WebSearch) — Stop forced full-turn retrospection that degraded to only logging commits; PostToolUse gives fresh context per tool result
- Removed Bash from journal-nudge matcher to eliminate noise from routine shell commands
- `validate-commit` hook now correctly parses heredoc-style commit messages instead of capturing raw shell syntax
- `validate-commit` hook skips `-F`/`--file` commits (can't validate file contents from command text)

## [0.1.20] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- `loaf report` CLI with `list`, `create`, `finalize`, `archive` subcommands
- Unified report template with status lifecycle (draft → final → archived) and multi-type support (research, audit, analysis, council)
- Drafts lifecycle policy — housekeeping flags state assessments for cleanup when linked session is archived
- `session:` field in state-assessment frontmatter for session linking

### Changed
- Research skill Topic Investigation writes directly to `.agents/reports/` instead of `.agents/drafts/`
- Housekeeping artifact lifecycle table split into state-assessments (session-linked) and brainstorms (user decision)

### Removed
- Findings template (`content/skills/research/templates/findings.md`) — replaced by unified report template

### Fixed
- Report CLI sanitizes path traversal in slug and type arguments
- Report CLI `list --status archived` now scans `archive/` directory
- Report CLI rejects ambiguous substring matches with candidate list

## [0.1.19] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- `validate-push` no longer false-positives when pushing a release commit (tag at HEAD)
- `workflow-pre-pr` no longer blocks when `[Unreleased]` is empty after release flow moved entries to a version header
- Existing `validate-push` tests fixed to place tag on prior commit (release detection was masking the checks)

### Added
- Report template with frontmatter for `.agents/reports/` (title, type, status, source)
- Research skill promotion path: drafts/ for in-progress, reports/ for final findings
- Wrap skill prompts for missing changelog entries on branches with commits
- 3 new hook tests: release-push pass, tagged-PR pass, spoofed-commit-message block

## [0.1.18] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- Session end now sets status to `stopped` instead of `paused`
- Same `claude_session_id` always resumes the session (fixes `claude -c` creating duplicate session files)
- Session branch tracking: adopts lone active session when switching branches mid-session
- Commit backfill on resume only includes commits made after the last session entry (no more pre-session noise)
- Journal nudge hook reworded to not hijack model responses

### Changed
- Rename `session(conclude)` entry type to `session(end)` for lifecycle marker
- Rename `conclude(scope)` entry type to `finding(scope)` for analysis results
- Update `EntryType` union and validation script to match new vocabulary
- Release skill post-merge cleanup now ends the session before switching branches

### Added
- Test coverage for branch adoption and same-session-id resume

## [0.1.17] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Add journal logging to workflow skills, broaden nudge hook (0beac80)
- STOP/RESUME separators, merge progress into conclude, remove redundant pause entry (5ab1464)
- PreCompact warns on placeholder Current State, PostCompact prints section content (b1478f6)

### Changed
- Unify session journal entries under session() type (b80fc86)

### Fixed
- Ad-hoc session title and remove Current State placeholder (6a90672)
- Journal amend detection and remove noisy post-commit nudge (bda0074)
- PreCompact warns when Current State timestamp is older than 5 minutes (1da7064)
- PreCompact detects stale Current State via timestamp, nudge requests timestamped heading (e720ca5)
- Resolve all test failures, update 4 stale KB files (e75372b)

## [0.1.16] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Session stability: subagent detection via `agent_id` in hook JSON — subagent spawns no longer create session churn
- `claude_session_id` tagging in session frontmatter for cross-conversation PAUSE/resume detection
- Ad-hoc task auto-creation: `/implement "free text"` creates a task and proceeds without user interaction
- Compaction-aware sessions: PreCompact requires state summary, PostCompact nudges session file re-read
- `## Current State` section seeded in new session files for compaction resilience
- PostCompact prompt nudge in hooks.yaml
- Session management policy (compact vs new session) in orchestration reference
- `/rename` prompt nudge in `/implement` and `loaf session start` output
- `start` journal entry type for new sessions (distinct from `resume`)
- Priority ordering + go/no-go gates as replacement for circuit breaker in spec template and skills

### Removed
- `appetite` field from `SpecEntry`/`SpecFrontmatter` types, parser, CLI display
- `## Circuit Breaker` sections from spec template, shape skill, and all active specs
- `archive-context.sh` hook (referenced stale `.work/` paths, superseded by journal-as-resumption)
- Plan file concept: deleted `content/templates/plan.md`, removed all references from implement, orchestration, housekeeping skills and config
- 5-minute gap heuristic for journal blank lines

### Fixed
- Duplicate commit journal entries: nudge now says "commit auto-logged, log decisions instead"
- Unrecognized Bash commands in `--from-hook` silently exit instead of logging noise
- `process.stdin.unref()` guarded for file-backed stdin (prevents crash on `< hook.json`)
- Cursor PostCompact event mapping added to `mapSessionEvent()`
- `start` entry excluded from `countJournalActivity` system types

### Changed
- Journal markers now all-caps: `SESSION STARTED`, `SESSION RESUMED`, `SESSION PAUSED`
- PAUSE separator written by `session end` only (correct timestamp), not `session start`
- Blank line rules simplified: after PAUSE, before start/resume, nothing else
- Session entry scopes removed from system entries (`pause:` not `pause(branch):`)

## [0.1.15] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- `Suggests Next` section in 8 pipeline skills for workflow continuity (triage→shape→breakdown→implement→release→wrap→housekeeping→reflect)

### Fixed
- 4 pre-tool hooks (`validate-commit`, `validate-push`, `workflow-pre-pr`, `detect-linear-magic`) fired on every Bash command — added `if:` conditions
- Hooks errored on unparseable stdin instead of passing silently

### Changed
- Session filenames simplified to fixed `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-session.md` — descriptions in frontmatter, not filenames

## [0.1.14] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- `/wrap` skill — responsible session shutdown with journal flush, loose end prompts, and housekeeping check
- `/triage` skill added to README pipeline
- `skill()` journal entry type for self-logging skill invocations
- Skill self-logging convention in CLAUDE.md

### Fixed
- `decide` keyword references in source-of-truth templates (`fenced-section.ts`, `session.md`, `hooks.yaml`) not updated to `decision`
- Session template still using old `- TIMESTAMP` format instead of `[TIMESTAMP]`

### Changed
- `workflow-pre-pr` hook warns when base branch has unpushed commits that would be absorbed into squash merge
- `loaf release` now auto-detects `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` as a version file

## [0.1.13] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- Session journal blank line between every entry — `trimEnd()` made separator condition unreachable
- Session resume replaying commits already logged in journal

### Changed
- `session start` archives paused sessions and creates fresh ones by default; `--resume` flag for explicit continuation
- `session end` writes `--- PAUSE ---` separator header between sessions
- Journal entry format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` brackets replace `- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` prefix
- `decide` entry type renamed to `decision`

### Removed
- Dead `formatEntry` function, unused `timestamp` parameter, filesystem sync retry loop
- Unnecessary `lockAcquired` flags, session variable aliases, multiline entry display handling

## [0.1.12] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- Three advisory hooks (pre-merge, pre-push, post-merge) broken since SPEC-020 — `json-parser.sh` dependency deleted but hooks not migrated

### Changed
- New `instruction:` field in hooks.yaml — hooks that output static files now use native `if` conditions instead of bash JSON parsing
- Removed 3 bash hook scripts and shared `json-parser.sh` library (-491 lines)
- Swap `tsx` for `bun` in build script — tsx was declared but not installed; bun is available natively via mise
- `validate-push` and `workflow-pre-pr` hooks downgraded from blocking to advisory — safety nets, not gates
- Release skill now creates PR before version bump when no PR exists (fixes `[Unreleased]` empty conflict)
- All three target builders (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode) generate `cat` commands for instruction-file hooks

## [0.1.11] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- MCP detection library — detects Linear and Serena across Claude Code and Cursor configurations
- Interactive MCP recommendation flow during `loaf install` with scope choice (global/project)
- `.agents/loaf.json` integration toggles for runtime feature gating without rebuilding

### Changed
- Bundled MCP servers (sequential-thinking, Linear, Serena) removed from Claude Code plugin manifest
- Session magic-word detection gated on `.agents/loaf.json` integration state
- `loaf install --upgrade` skips MCP recommendations
- Integration config merged from `.agents/config.json` into `.agents/loaf.json` per ADR-007
- `AgentsConfig`/`readAgentsConfig` renamed to `LoafConfig`/`readLoafConfig`
- `/cleanup` skill and `loaf cleanup` CLI command renamed to `/housekeeping` and `loaf housekeeping`
- Session journal nudge hooks changed from advisory to imperative ("REQUIRED" before responding)
- 4 knowledge base files rewritten for post-SPEC-020 architecture (hook-system, build-system, task-system, skill-architecture)

### Removed
- `mcpServers` section from plugin.json and Claude Code build target
- `linear-mcp.sh` wrapper script
- `.agents/config.json` (merged into `.agents/loaf.json`)

## [0.1.9] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Amp target (experimental) — skills + runtime plugin for the Amp editor
- `loaf check` CLI — unified TypeScript enforcement backend replacing ~30 shell hook scripts
- `loaf session` subcommands — `start`, `end`, `log`, `list`, `archive` replace resume-session/reference-session skills
- CLI reference skill — non-user-invocable knowledge skill with per-target command substitution
- `council` skill (renamed from council-session) — user-invocable council workflow
- Codex Bash-matching enforcement hooks via generated `.codex/hooks.json`
- Runtime plugins generated for OpenCode (`hooks.ts`) and Amp (`loaf.js`)
- Self-contained `loaf` binary bundled in Claude Code plugin
- Fenced-section management for `loaf install` target project files
- Vulnerability scanner integration in security-audit (trivy, semgrep, npm audit) gated behind VALIDATION_LEVEL

### Changed
- Shared skill intermediate layer (`dist/skills/`) eliminates duplicated build logic across 7 targets
- All 25 skills reordered to structural convention (Critical Rules → Verification → Quick Reference → Topics)
- 16 skills gained Critical Rules sections; all skills now have Verification sections
- Hook payloads normalize both flat (`tool_input`) and nested (`tool.input`) shapes for cross-harness compatibility
- `failClosed` enforcement across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex hooks
- Signal-killed hook subprocesses now fail closed (`code ?? 1` instead of `code || 0`)
- Session archival uses atomic rename-first to prevent corruption on crash
- Journal entries use proper EntryType values (`resume`/`conclude` instead of invalid `context`)
- Cursor post-tool hook timeouts read from config instead of hardcoded 30s

### Removed
- ~30 legacy shell hook scripts (`content/hooks/pre-tool/`, `post-tool/`)
- 4 shared bash libraries (`json-parser.sh`, `config-reader.sh`, `agent-detector.sh`, `timeout-manager.sh`)
- `resume-session` and `reference-session` skills (absorbed by `loaf session`)

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- All 30 skill descriptions rewritten to fit Claude Code's 250-char truncation budget (SPEC-014 follow-up)
- Removed `/ship` alias skill — `/release` already triggers on "ship it"

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `/release` skill — orchestrates squash merge ritual: pre-flight, docs freshness, housekeeping, version bump, merge, cleanup (SPEC-019)

- `loaf release --yes` — skip confirmation prompt for non-interactive use
- Release library test suite: version, changelog, commits, options, and command integration tests

### Changed
- Option validation and skip-flag logic extracted to `cli/lib/release/options.ts`
- `/release` skill detects curated changelog entries under `[Unreleased]` and preserves them instead of regenerating from commits

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- 4 focused skills extracted from foundations: git-workflow, debugging, security-compliance, documentation-standards (SPEC-014)
- 3 functional profile agents: implementer (Smith), reviewer (Sentinel), researcher (Ranger) with enforced tool boundaries (SPEC-014)
- SOUL.md — Warden identity (Arandil) for coordinator sessions (SPEC-014)
- Self-healing SessionStart hook that restores SOUL.md from canonical template if missing (SPEC-014)

### Changed
- Foundations skill slimmed to code style, TDD, verification, review, and production readiness (SPEC-014)
- All 29 skill descriptions rewritten with action verb openers, user-intent phrases, negative routing, and success criteria (SPEC-014)
- Hook `skill:` fields reassigned to match new skill boundaries (SPEC-014)

- Legacy `plugin-groups` section from hooks.yaml (SPEC-014)

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- `loaf cleanup` command — scan `.agents/` artifacts and recommend cleanup actions (SPEC-012)
  - Covers all 7 artifact types: sessions, tasks, specs, plans, drafts, councils, reports
  - `--dry-run` and `--sessions`/`--specs`/`--plans`/`--drafts` filters
  - Non-TTY pipe-safe output (behaves like `--dry-run` when piped)
  - Interactive per-item confirmation with delete previews
  - Nested frontmatter support (`session.*`, `council.*`, `report.*`)
  - Dual council schema support (council-session + orchestration formats)
  - Detects drafts promoted to specs via `source` field cross-reference
- Shared prompt helpers (`askYesNo`, `askChoice`, `isTTY`) in `cli/lib/prompts.ts`
- Pre-merge prompt hook for squash merge conventions (clean body, no auto-dump)
- Prompt hook support in build system (Claude Code target; filtered for other targets)
- Advisory `/reflect` suggestion in `/implement` AFTER phase when session has extractable learnings (SPEC-011)
- Post-implementation reflection flag in `/shape` Step 9 for sessions with strategic tensions (SPEC-011)
- `/reflect` recommendation in `/cleanup` extraction checks before archiving decision-rich sessions (SPEC-011)

### Changed
- Spec cleanup (task archival, spec archival) moved to pre-merge on the feature branch instead of post-merge on main
- Post-merge housekeeping reduced to: pull main, delete branch, suggest reflection
- `/cleanup` skill updated to reference CLI as execution engine (skill = policy + Linear, CLI = filesystem)

### Fixed
- Pre-push hook changed from unconditionally blocking (exit 2) to advisory (exit 0)
- Stale `docs/specs/` paths in `/reflect`, `/shape`, and spec template — now `.agents/specs/`

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- `loaf task archive` command — move completed tasks to archive and update TASKS.json atomically

- `council-session` skill changed to model-invoked (not user-invocable)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-27

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-15

The pre-CLI era, collapsed into a single anchor entry. Fifty-three commits between 2026-01-18 and 2026-03-15 carried their own version line — `1.0.0` through `1.17.4` — and predate this changelog, which was introduced later (see `0.1.3`). They are not renumbered individually; `0.1.0` stands for the whole era, and the tag `v1.17.4` (`c7e7eb9d`, "chore: pre-CLI restructuring snapshot") marks its final commit.

### Added

- Loaf as a shell-and-Node content distribution: skills, agents, hooks, templates, and config authored under `src/` and built by `build/build.js` into per-harness outputs for Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Codex, and Gemini
- `install.sh`, the installer with its own built-in harness detection and a hand-rolled 256-color ANSI terminal UI; `scripts/detect-tools.sh` shipped alongside it as a standalone `--json` detection utility

### Changed

- The era ends at the pre-CLI restructuring snapshot; the CLI rewrite that replaced the shell installer and the Node builder opens the next entry, `0.1.1`
