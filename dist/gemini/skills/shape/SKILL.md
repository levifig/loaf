  Shapes ideas into implementable specs with scope boundaries and test
  conditions. Use when the user asks "shape this idea" or "write a spec."

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

Shaping transforms raw ideas into **well-defined SPECs** with clear problem statement, solution direction (not blueprint), hard boundaries, identified rabbit holes, and enough direction without too much constraint.

Evaluates ideas against strategic context (VISION, STRATEGY, ARCHITECTURE) to ensure alignment.

---

## CRITICAL: Interview Extensively

Unlike `/idea` (quick capture), shaping requires **deep understanding**. Ask about edge cases, conflicts with existing patterns, hidden complexity, and scope boundaries. Use `AskUserQuestion` throughout.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Parse Input

`$ARGUMENTS` should reference an idea file, problem description, or requirement area. If unclear, ask what to shape.

### Step 2: Gather Strategic Context

Read in order: VISION.md, STRATEGY.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, existing specs.

### Step 3: Evaluate Strategic Fit

| Question | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Does this advance our vision? | VISION.md |
| Does this serve our target personas? | STRATEGY.md |
| Does this fit our technical constraints? | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Does this conflict with existing work? | docs/specs/ |

If misaligned: surface the tension, adjust idea, or note for `/reflect` later.

### Step 4: Interview for Shaping

Define boundaries, not tasks:
- Core problem, in/out scope, rabbit holes, no-gos
- Test conditions, appetite, circuit breaker
- Risks and open questions

### Step 5: Draft the Spec

Create spec following [spec template](templates/spec.md).

### Step 6: Generate Spec ID

```bash
ls docs/specs/SPEC-*.md docs/specs/archive/SPEC-*.md 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -oE 'SPEC-[0-9]+' | sort -t- -k2 -n | tail -1 | awk -F- '{print $2 + 1}'
```

If none exist, start with `SPEC-001`.

### Step 7: Present for Approval

Present full spec. **Do NOT create spec file without explicit approval.** User may adjust scope, change appetite, add constraints, request splitting, or decide not to proceed.

### Step 8: Create Spec File

After approval: create `docs/specs/SPEC-{id}-{slug}.md`, update idea file status if applicable.

---

## Spec Lifecycle

```
drafting -> approved -> implementing -> complete -> archived
```

### Splitting Large Specs

When too big for appetite, split into sub-specs. Each has its own appetite, can be worked independently, and references the parent.

---

## Strategic Tensions

**Don't fix strategy during shaping.** Instead:
1. Note the tension in the spec's "Strategic Alignment" section
2. Document what might need to change
3. Proceed with shaping (or pause if blocking)
4. Use `/reflect` after implementation to evolve strategy

---

## Guardrails

1. **Interview extensively** -- not quick capture
2. **Evaluate strategic fit** -- don't shape in a vacuum
3. **Respect appetite** -- fixed time, variable scope
4. **Document rabbit holes** -- prevent scope creep
5. **Clear test conditions** -- observable outcomes
6. **Circuit breaker** -- plan for running out of time
7. **Get approval** -- don't create without confirmation
8. **Note tensions, don't fix** -- strategy evolves via /reflect
