# Record Contract

`project-management/v1` is a semantic protocol, not a transport or client. The current harness exposes connections, the selected provider skill maps native fields, and the tracker owns the resulting record.

## Operation Sequence

1. Run `connection.discover` over connections already visible to the harness.
   Prefer a usable GitHub MCP matching `integrations.github.account` when GitHub is the tracker, and select that connection before resource access. If none is available or the connector identity is missing, ambiguous, or mismatched, an installed authenticated `gh` available to the main agent is a valid exposed connection before asking the user to configure MCP. Verify MCP identity through the connector and `gh` identity separately; `gh` is not MCP evidence. Unrelated Linear MCP does not decide GitHub destination.
2. Select one exact native destination; stop if the choice changes workspace, team, or named GitHub board and remains ambiguous. When GitHub is the tracker, the destination includes the repository and the Projects v2 board, identified by board title (or “the project board” when that title matches the repository or Loaf project). Never identify a GitHub board as `Project #N`.
3. Run `capability.discover` and select the highest honest fidelity for the requested operation.
4. Read current native state.
5. Route each requested semantic once to its canonical native field and apply one bounded mutation when requested and authorized.
6. Re-read native state and return the result envelope.

Creation includes a prior search or destination read for an existing matching record. If a create or comment request returns no authoritative identity or state, do not repeat it blindly: inspect native state and report `indeterminate` when duplication cannot be excluded.

## Result Envelope

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `operation` | One identifier from the closed common vocabulary |
| `destination` | Provider plus native workspace/team/project scope |
| `native_ref` | Tracker-issued identity, or empty only when no identity was observed |
| `outcome` | `confirmed`, `unchanged`, `partial`, `failed`, or `indeterminate` |
| `fidelity` | `exact`, `advisory`, `manual`, or `unsupported` |
| `observed_state` | Relevant authoritative state from the final read |
| `verification_evidence` | What read or provider response proves the outcome |

`partial` means some bounded effects were confirmed and others were not. `indeterminate` means the agent cannot prove whether a native effect occurred. Neither may be rounded up to success.

## Semantic Separation

- `work.create` and `work.update` write native work fields such as the title; the definition packet does not carry a second title copy.
- `definition.write` routes the ephemeral work-contract packet into canonical problem, completion, exclusion, verification, and risk fields. The packet is not stored or copied as a monolithic shadow artifact.
- `hierarchy.change` changes parent/child structure.
- `dependency.change` changes blocking or related-work edges.
- `status.transition` selects a valid native workflow state after reading available states. On GitHub that is Issue open/closed together with board Status; a missing board is a configuration gap, not an open/closed stand-in for Todo.
- `comment.append` adds collaboration or evidence only.

When a provider or connection lacks an exact mapping, report the lower fidelity. Do not encode a relationship in prose, claim a status through a comment, or replace a canonical definition with an activity note. Unsupported hierarchy or dependency semantics remain unsupported; prose is not a substitute.
