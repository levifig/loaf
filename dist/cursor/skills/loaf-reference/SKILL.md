  Documents how agents operate the Loaf CLI: command discovery via loaf --help,
  JSON diagnosis surfaces, guided config maintenance, and troubleshooting. Use
  when unsure which loaf command to invoke or how to validate project state. Not
  for workflow guidance (workflow skills own their CLI contracts) or build
  internals.

# Loaf Reference

## Contents
- Operating Rules
- Command Index
- Topics

The Loaf operating manual for agents: how to discover commands, diagnose project
state, and keep configuration current. It teaches reading the CLI, not
memorizing it.

**Note:** This file is auto-generated from native CLI reference metadata. Do not edit manually.

## Operating Rules

- Get exact, current syntax live: `loaf --help` lists every command, `loaf <command> --help` details one. This index is a map, not the contract.
- Prefer `--json` surfaces when diagnosing: `loaf config check --json`, `loaf state doctor --json`, `loaf change check --json`. Parse the structured output instead of scraping human-readable text.
- Run the deterministic CLI command before hand-editing anything it manages; the command owns its files.
- Use `--fix` only for safe, mechanical repairs, and review what it changed.
- Ask the user for project-owned choices — GitHub account, tracker or integration election, which harnesses to install — never guess them.
- Never hand-edit Loaf-managed hook files; regenerate them through `loaf build` and `loaf install`.
- Re-run the relevant check after any change and confirm it passes.
- Log meaningful decisions to the journal: `loaf journal log "decision(scope): ..."`.
