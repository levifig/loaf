name: reflect
description: >-
  Integrates learnings from shipped work into strategic documents (VISION,
  STRATEGY, ARCHITECTURE). Covers evidence gathering from completed specs and
  sessions, insight extraction, and document update proposals. Use after
  completing significant work, or when the user asks "what did we learn?" or
  "update strategy based on this." Produces evidence-based update proposals for
  strategic documents. Not for pre-implementation planning (use shape) or active
  strategy discovery (use strategy).
version: 1.17.0

# Reflect

Update VISION, STRATEGY, and ARCHITECTURE based on proven implementation.

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

Strategy evolves through **shipping**, not theorizing.

After completing work, `/reflect` extracts learnings and proposes updates to strategic documents. **Don't update strategy during planning or shaping.** Update after implementation proves (or disproves) assumptions.

---

## When to Reflect

- After completing a spec or shipping a significant feature
- After discovering something unexpected during implementation
- After a series of related sessions
- Periodically (monthly/quarterly) to consolidate learnings

---

## Process

### Step 1: Parse Input

`$ARGUMENTS` can be: a spec ID (`SPEC-001`), a topic ("authentication learnings"), or empty (general reflection on recent work).

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

Sources:
1. **Completed specs** (`docs/specs/SPEC-*.md` with status `complete`) -- look for "Lessons Learned"
2. **Session files** (`.agents/sessions/`) -- insights, surprises, pivots
3. **Recent commits** (`git log --oneline -30`)
4. **Implementation reality** -- what was harder/easier than expected? What assumptions were wrong?

### Step 3: Interview for Insights

Ask: What surprised you? What would you do differently? Did any assumptions prove wrong? What did we learn about users or technical constraints? Strategic implications?

### Step 4: Identify Implications

Map learnings to documents:

| Learning Type | Document |
|---------------|----------|
| User behavior / market / problem understanding | STRATEGY.md |
| Direction changes | VISION.md |
| Technical constraints / patterns | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Decision updates | ADR (new or supersede) |

### Step 5: Draft Proposals

For each document needing updates, create proposals following [update-proposal template](templates/update-proposal.md).

### Step 6: Present and Await Approval

Present all proposals grouped by document. **Do NOT update strategic documents without explicit approval.**

User may: approve all, approve some, modify proposals, defer updates, or request more evidence.

### Step 7: Apply Updates

After approval:
1. Update documents with approved changes
2. Create ADRs if needed (see `/architecture` for format)
3. Archive completed specs if appropriate
4. Announce what was updated

---

## Guardrails

1. **Evidence-based** -- proposals need supporting evidence from shipped work
2. **Post-implementation** -- reflect after shipping, not before
3. **Get approval** -- don't update strategic docs without confirmation
4. **Consolidate** -- batch related learnings, don't create micro-updates
5. **Link back** -- reference specs/sessions that informed the update
6. **Archive completed work** -- move done specs to archive
