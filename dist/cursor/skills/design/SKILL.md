# Design Principles

**Philosophy**: Design is problem-solving through systematic thinking, with accessibility and user needs at the center. Every design decision must be intentional, accessible, and meaningful.

## Quick Reference

| Topic | Key Principle | Reference |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Core | User-first, accessible by default, consistent, minimal | [reference/core.md](reference/core.md) |
| Color | Function first, 4.5:1 contrast minimum, never color-only | [reference/color.md](reference/color.md) |
| Typography | Legible, accessible, reinforce hierarchy | [reference/typography.md](reference/typography.md) |
| Spacing | 8pt grid, consistent rhythm, logical properties | [reference/spacing.md](reference/spacing.md) |
| Responsive | Mobile-first, content-out, fluid layouts | [reference/responsive.md](reference/responsive.md) |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA minimum, keyboard navigable, screen reader compatible | [reference/a11y.md](reference/a11y.md) |
| Motion | Purposeful, natural, respect reduced motion | [reference/motion.md](reference/motion.md) |
| Systems | Tokens, components, patterns, governance | [reference/systems.md](reference/systems.md) |

## Core Principles

### 1. User-First
Every design decision must serve user needs and goals.
- Understand user context: Who, what, why, when, where?
- Validate assumptions with real users
- Measure outcomes that matter to users

### 2. Accessible by Default
Accessibility is not a feature - it is a requirement.
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum, AAA as aspiration
- Keyboard navigation for all functionality
- 4.5:1 contrast for text, 3:1 for UI components
- Never use color as the sole indicator

### 3. Consistent
Consistency reduces cognitive load and builds trust.
- Design tokens as single source of truth
- Component reuse over reinvention
- Predictable naming conventions

### 4. Minimal
Every element must justify its existence.
- Progressive disclosure
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Sufficient whitespace

### 5. Delightful
Good design feels effortless.
- Smooth, purposeful interactions
- Thoughtful details
- Performance as a feature

## Design Tokens

Use semantic tokens, never hardcoded values.

```typescript
// Pattern: [category]-[property]-[variant?]-[state?]
color-text-primary
color-background-secondary
spacing-component-padding-md
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Never use pixel values directly** - Always use design tokens
2. **Never use divs for buttons** - Use semantic HTML
3. **Never skip alt text** - All images need descriptions
4. **Never use color alone** - Combine with icons/text
5. **Never ignore reduced motion** - Respect user preferences
6. **Never animate layout properties** - Use transform/opacity only
7. **Never skip focus indicators** - Minimum 3:1 contrast
8. **Never exceed 75ch line length** - Optimal readability at 65ch

## Quality Checklist

Every design deliverable must meet:

- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- [ ] Keyboard navigable
- [ ] Screen reader compatible
- [ ] Color contrast verified (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)
- [ ] Focus indicators visible (3:1 contrast)
- [ ] Reduced motion respected
- [ ] Uses design tokens exclusively
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Documented in component library
