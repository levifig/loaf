## Branch Management

**All new development work should happen on a dedicated branch.**

### Getting Branch Name

1. **If Linear issue exists**: Use the `branchName` field from `get_issue` response
   - Linear auto-generates branch names like `username/plt-123-issue-title`
   - These are pre-formatted and consistent with team conventions

2. **If no Linear issue**: Create branch name from session description
   - Format: `feature/<session-description>` or `fix/<session-description>`
   - Use kebab-case, keep it concise

### Branch Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check current branch status
git status

# 2. Create and checkout the branch (use Linear's branchName if available)
git checkout -b <branch-name>

# 3. Confirm branch creation
git branch --show-current
```

### Record in Session

Add branch info to session frontmatter:

```yaml
session:
  title: "..."
  branch: "username/plt-123-issue-title"  # Track the working branch
  linear_issue: "PLT-123"
```

**Important:** All implementation agents will work on this branch. The branch should be ready for PR when work completes.

---

## Team Routing

When creating Linear issues, suggest the appropriate team:

1. **Analyze task description** for keywords (see `linear-workflow` Skill)
2. **Check known_teams** in `.agents/config.json`
3. **If team is new to project**, ask user for confirmation:
   > "This task seems best suited for the **Security** team (matched: 'auth', 'vulnerability').
   > Security hasn't been used in this project yet. Add this team?"
4. **If user confirms**, add team to `known_teams` in config
5. **Create issue** with suggested team

### Team Suggestion Example

```
Task: "Fix authentication bypass vulnerability in API"
         |
Keywords matched: "authentication", "vulnerability", "API"
         |
Top suggestions:
  1. Security (score: 2) -- "authentication", "vulnerability"
  2. Backend (score: 1) -- "API"
         |
Suggest Security, confirm if new to project
```

Use Linear MCP's `list_teams` to get all workspace teams for validation.

## Diagram Consideration

For multi-file or multi-service changes, consider adding architecture diagrams to the session file.

### When to Create Diagrams

| Scenario | Diagram Type |
|----------|--------------|
| Changes span 3+ services | Component diagram (interaction points) |
| Data flow modifications | Sequence diagram (trace data path) |
| Schema/model changes | ERD (table relationships) |
| New API endpoints | Sequence diagram (request/response) |
| State machine logic | State diagram (transitions) |

### Quick Check

Ask yourself:
1. Will this work touch multiple services or layers?
2. Is there a data flow that needs to be understood?
3. Would a visual help communicate the approach?

If yes to any, add an `## Architecture Diagrams` section to the session file.

### Diagram Template

```markdown
## Architecture Diagrams

### [Descriptive Name]

```mermaid
[Use flowchart, sequenceDiagram, erDiagram, or stateDiagram-v2]
```

**Purpose**: Why this diagram clarifies the work
**Files involved**: `path/to/file1.py`, `path/to/file2.py`
```

See `foundations` skill `reference/diagrams.md` for Mermaid syntax and best practices.

## Plan Mode Integration

For complex tasks, use **Plan Mode** to explore before implementing:

### When to Use Plan Mode

- Task requires exploring unfamiliar codebase areas
- Multiple valid implementation approaches exist
- Dependencies between tasks need mapping
- User should approve approach before work begins

### Phase 1: Explore (Plan Mode)

```
1. Use Task(Explore) or Task(Plan) to investigate codebase
2. Map existing patterns and conventions
3. Identify integration points
4. Document findings in session file
```

### Phase 2: Plan and Store

When the Plan agent returns a plan:

1. **Generate plan filename:**

   ```bash
   date -u +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"  # e.g., 20250123-143500
   ```

   Format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-{plan-slug}.md`

2. **Save plan to `.agents/plans/`:**

   ```
   .agents/plans/20250123-143500-auth-api-design.md
   ```

3. **Plan file format:**

   ```markdown
   ---
   session: 20250123-140000-feature-auth
   created: 2025-01-23T14:35:00Z
   status: pending  # pending | approved | superseded
   ---

   # Auth API Design Plan

   ## Overview
   [Plan content from Plan agent]

   ## Implementation Steps
   1. ...
   2. ...
   ```

4. **Update session file with plan reference:**

   ```yaml
   plans:
     - 20250123-143500-auth-api-design.md
   ```

5. **Present plan to user for approval**

### Phase 3: Approval and Implementation

```
1. On user approval, update plan status to "approved"
2. Spawn implementation agents
3. Reference plan file in agent prompts
4. Execute in approved direction
```

### Multiple Plans Per Session

Complex work may require multiple plans:

```yaml
# In session frontmatter
plans:
  - 20250123-143500-auth-api-design.md      # approved
  - 20250123-150000-auth-frontend.md        # approved
  - 20250123-153000-auth-testing.md         # pending
```

Each plan is a checkpoint that can be referenced, revised, or superseded.

### Skip Planning When

- Task is straightforward (single file, clear change)
- User has provided explicit detailed instructions
- Pattern is well-established in codebase

---

## Linear Status Management

**Keep Linear status synchronized with actual work state:**

| Work State | Linear Status |
|------------|---------------|
| Session started | In Progress |
| Blocked/waiting for user | In Progress (add blocker comment) |
| Work completed | Done (or In Review if PR pending) |

---

## Handoff State Requirements

**The session file must ALWAYS be handoff-ready.** After every significant action:

1. Update `## Current State` to reflect what just happened
2. Update `orchestration.current_task` in frontmatter
3. Log completed agent work with outcomes
4. Ensure anyone could pick up the work immediately

---

## Timestamps for User Context

**Print the current date and timestamp when:**

- Waiting for user input or decision
- Completing a phase of work
- Encountering a blocker
- Session ends or pauses

Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]`

Generate with: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC"`

---

## Transcript Archival

After `/compact` or `/clear`, archive conversation transcripts for future reference.

### Process

1. **Get transcript path** from Claude Code output after compaction
2. **Create transcripts directory** if needed:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .agents/transcripts
   ```
3. **Copy transcript** with descriptive name:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/transcript.jsonl .agents/transcripts/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-description.jsonl
   ```
4. **Update session frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   transcripts:
     - 20260123-143500-pre-compact.jsonl
   ```

### When to Archive

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Before `/compact` | Archive current transcript |
| Before `/clear` | Archive current transcript |
| Session end | Archive final transcript |

### Benefits

- **Audit trail** - Full history of decisions and work
- **Knowledge extraction** - Mining past sessions for patterns
- **Debugging** - Understanding how errors occurred
- **Training** - Learning from past sessions

---

## Task Completion

When a task-coupled session completes:

1. **Update task status** (local file or Linear)
2. **Check spec progress:**
   - List all tasks for the spec
   - If all done -> mark spec as `complete`
   - If tasks remain -> spec stays `implementing`
3. **Archive session** (standard process)

### Spec Completion Check

```bash
# For local tasks
grep -l "spec: SPEC-001" .agents/tasks/*.md | wc -l
# If 0, all tasks done

# For Linear
# Check all issues with spec label
```
