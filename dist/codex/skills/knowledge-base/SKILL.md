description: >-
  Provides guidance for creating, updating, and reviewing project knowledge
  files. Covers frontmatter schema, naming conventions, staleness detection via
  covers: field, and the review workflow. Use when creating new knowledge files,
  updating existing ones, or when the agent needs to understand knowledge
  management conventions. Not for retrieval or search (use QMD directly). Not
  for architectural decisions (use ADRs). Not for agent instructions (use
  CLAUDE.md).

# Knowledge Base

Conventions and workflows for managing project knowledge files -- structured
domain knowledge that lives in `docs/knowledge/` and persists across sessions.

## When to Create a Knowledge File

Create a knowledge file when information:

1. **Requires context beyond the code** -- domain rules, business logic constraints,
   cross-cutting patterns that cannot be expressed in types or docstrings
2. **Spans multiple files or modules** -- conventions or contracts that apply across
   the codebase, not localized to one function
3. **Would be lost between sessions** -- insights that an agent needs repeatedly but
   cannot derive from code alone
4. **Serves as extended agent memory** -- roadmap context, implementation plans,
   strategic direction that informs decisions

Do NOT create knowledge files for:
- Self-documenting code (types, docstrings, comments are sufficient)
- One-off architectural decisions (write an ADR instead)
- Agent behavior instructions (put those in CLAUDE.md)
- User preferences or session pointers (those belong in MEMORY.md)

## Topics

| Topic | Reference | Use When |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Frontmatter Schema | [frontmatter-schema.md](references/frontmatter-schema.md) | Creating or validating knowledge file frontmatter |
| Naming Conventions | [naming-conventions.md](references/naming-conventions.md) | Deciding where to put knowledge and what to name it |

| Template | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| [knowledge-file.md](templates/knowledge-file.md) | Creating a new knowledge file from scratch |

## The covers: Field

The `covers:` field is the core innovation of the knowledge management system.
It links knowledge to code paths via glob patterns, enabling automatic staleness
detection.

### How It Works

1. Author declares `covers:` globs in knowledge file frontmatter
2. Globs resolve from the git repository root
3. `loaf kb check` queries `git log --since={last_reviewed}` for matching files
4. If commits exist since last review, the knowledge file is flagged as potentially stale

### Good covers: Patterns

```yaml
covers:
  - "src/pipeline/registry.py"          # Specific file
  - "src/models/engine_*.py"            # Wildcard within directory
  - "src/thermal/**/*.py"               # Recursive directory
```

### Patterns to Avoid

```yaml
covers:
  - "src/**"                            # Too broad -- constant false positives
  - "**/*.py"                           # Covers everything, means nothing
  - "*.md"                              # Documentation changes != knowledge staleness
```

The goal is precision: cover the code paths whose changes would actually
invalidate the knowledge. Broad globs lead to alert fatigue.

### When to Omit covers:

Files without `covers:` are valid knowledge files but cannot use automated
staleness detection. Omit `covers:` when:

- The knowledge is purely conceptual (no specific code paths)
- The file covers external domain rules not tied to implementation
- You are unsure which paths to cover (add them later when the mapping is clear)

## Review Workflow

### Check What Is Stale

```bash
loaf kb check
```

Shows knowledge files where covered code paths have changed since `last_reviewed`.

### Validate Frontmatter

```bash
loaf kb validate
```

Checks all knowledge files for valid frontmatter: required fields present,
correct types, valid glob patterns.

### Review a File

```bash
loaf kb review <file>
```

After reading and updating a knowledge file, mark it as reviewed. This updates
the `last_reviewed` date to today.

### Overview

```bash
loaf kb status
```

Summary of all knowledge files: total count, stale count, files missing
`covers:`, last review dates.

## What Goes Where

| Surface | Contains | Decision Test |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Code** (docstrings, types) | What the code does | Is it self-documenting? |
| **Knowledge files** | Domain rules, cross-cutting context, roadmap | Requires context beyond the code? |
| **ADRs** | Why we chose this approach | Is it an architectural decision? |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Agent instructions, conventions | Is it about how agents should behave? |
| **MEMORY.md** | User preferences, session pointers | Is it personal or ephemeral? |

CLAUDE.md may reference knowledge files but should never duplicate their content.

system (QMD integration, growth loops, cross-project sharing), see
`docs/knowledge/knowledge-management-design.md`.

## Critical Rules

### Always
- Include `topics` (min 1) and `last_reviewed` in frontmatter
- Use kebab-case filenames in `docs/knowledge/`
- Add `covers:` globs when the knowledge maps to specific code paths
- Run `loaf kb validate` before committing new knowledge files
- Mark files reviewed with `loaf kb review` after updating

### Never
- Duplicate code documentation in knowledge files
- Use date prefixes on knowledge filenames (unlike sessions or ideas)
- Use overly broad `covers:` globs that trigger constant staleness alerts
- Skip the `last_reviewed` field -- it is required for the lifecycle to work
- Store knowledge files outside `docs/knowledge/` (ADRs go in `docs/decisions/`)
