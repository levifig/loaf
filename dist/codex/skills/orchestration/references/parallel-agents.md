## Philosophy

**Independence is the prerequisite.** Parallel work only makes sense when tasks don't depend on each other. Shared state or sequential dependencies mean sequential execution.

**Divide by concern, not by size.** Split work along natural boundaries (frontend/backend, module A/module B), not arbitrary chunks. This minimizes merge conflicts and coordination overhead.

**Explicit boundaries, clean handoffs.** Each parallel stream should have clear inputs, outputs, and success criteria. Ambiguity creates integration nightmares.

**Fail fast, coordinate early.** If one stream discovers a blocker that affects others, surface it immediately. Don't let parallel streams diverge too far before checking alignment.

## Quick Reference

| Condition | Parallel? | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Tasks touch different files | ✅ Yes | No merge conflicts |
| Tasks modify same module | ⚠️ Maybe | Need clear boundaries |
| Task B needs Task A's output | ❌ No | Sequential dependency |
| Tasks share state/database | ⚠️ Maybe | Risk of race conditions |
| Tasks are truly independent | ✅ Yes | Maximum parallelism |

## When to Parallelize

### Good Candidates

- **Different concerns:** Backend API + Frontend UI for same feature
- **Different modules:** User service + Payment service
- **Different layers:** Database migration + Application code
- **Research tasks:** Investigate option A + Investigate option B

### Poor Candidates

- **Shared files:** Both tasks modify `config.yaml`
- **Sequential logic:** Task B calls API built by Task A
- **Shared state:** Both tasks write to same database table
- **Unclear boundaries:** "Implement feature" with no decomposition

## Dispatch Pattern

### 1. Identify Independence

Before dispatching, verify:

```
□ No shared files between tasks
□ No sequential dependencies (A before B)
□ Clear success criteria for each task
□ Defined integration point (how streams merge)
```

### 2. Define Each Stream

For each parallel task:

```markdown
## Task: [Name]

**Scope:** [What this stream handles]
**Files:** [Files this stream will touch]
**Success:** [How to know it's done]
**Output:** [What it produces for integration]
```

### 3. Dispatch

Use the Task tool with multiple parallel invocations:

```
[Single message with multiple Task tool calls]
- Task 1: Backend API implementation
- Task 2: Frontend component implementation
- Task 3: Database migration
```

### 4. Coordinate Results

When streams complete:
- Verify each stream's success criteria
- Check for unexpected conflicts
- Integrate outputs
- Run integration tests

## Critical Rules

### Always

- Verify independence before dispatching
- Define clear boundaries for each stream
- Specify success criteria upfront
- Plan the integration point
- Check for conflicts after completion

### Never

- Parallelize tasks with shared mutable state
- Assume streams won't conflict
- Skip the integration verification
- Dispatch without clear success criteria
- Ignore early warnings from parallel streams

## Integration with Loaf Workflow

| Command | Parallel Opportunity |
|---------|---------------------|
| `/breakdown` | Identify parallelizable tasks during decomposition |
| `/implement` | Single task, usually sequential |
| `/implement` | Runs dependency-wave orchestration, including parallel-safe tasks |

## Conflict Resolution

When parallel streams produce conflicts:

1. **File conflicts:** Review both changes, merge manually
2. **Logic conflicts:** Determine correct behavior, update one stream
3. **Interface conflicts:** Agree on contract, update implementations

## Example: Parallel Feature Implementation

```markdown
## Feature: User Profile Page

### Stream A: Backend (backend-dev agent)
- Files: `api/users.py`, `tests/test_users.py`
- Success: GET /users/{id}/profile returns user data
- Output: API contract documented

### Stream B: Frontend (frontend-dev agent)
- Files: `components/Profile.tsx`, `tests/Profile.test.tsx`
- Success: Profile component renders mock data
- Output: Component accepts ProfileData prop

### Integration Point
- Connect frontend to real API
- E2E test: profile page loads real user data
```
