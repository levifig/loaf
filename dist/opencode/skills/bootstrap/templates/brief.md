# Brief Template

**Location:** `docs/BRIEF.md`

The BRIEF is a *historical snapshot* of project intake. It is written once during bootstrap and is not a living document. After bootstrap, the useful content from the BRIEF lives in the Core Docs (VISION.md, STRATEGY.md, ARCHITECTURE.md) and AGENTS.md -- readers should consult those living documents, not this file. The BRIEF stands as a frozen record of how the project entered Loaf.

```yaml
---
source: file | text | folder | interview | pitch
original_path: ""       # Path to external source file, if copied into project
created: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
archived: true          # Always true -- BRIEF is a historical snapshot, not a working doc

# Project Brief

## Problem Statement

[What problem does this project solve? Why does it exist? Be specific about the pain -- vague problems produce vague solutions. Problem-space only; do not design the architecture here.]

## Who Has It

[Who experiences this problem? Describe them concretely -- role, context, frequency of the pain. Avoid "developers" or "users" without qualification.]

## Current Alternatives

[What do target users do today? Existing tools, manual workarounds, or "nothing" are all valid answers. Understanding the status quo clarifies what "better" means.]

## Value Proposition

[Why is solving this worth it? What becomes true for the people who have the problem if this project lands? Describe value and success, not features or architecture.]

## Constraints

[Non-negotiable requirements: technical, legal, organizational, or philosophical. Things that bound the solution space before design begins.]

- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

## Sequencing and Relationships

[How the initial arc hangs together as progressively larger useful operator journeys — which problems become early tracker records, what depends on what, sequencing stated as prose. Do not use component layers as milestones. No invented relation fields; native relationships only when supported.]

## Sources and Research Links

[Evidence that informed this framing — competitive scans, prior art, issue links, research notes. Link rather than paste.]

## Open Questions

[Unresolved items that need answers before or during implementation. Mark each with its urgency: blocking (must resolve before work starts) or deferrable (can resolve during implementation).]

- [ ] [Question 1] -- blocking | deferrable
- [ ] [Question 2] -- blocking | deferrable
```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Values | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| `source` | Yes | `file`, `text`, `folder`, `interview`, `pitch` | How the brief entered the project |
| `original_path` | No | File path string | Only when copied from an external location |
| `created` | Yes | ISO 8601 timestamp | When the brief was persisted |
| `archived` | Yes | `true` | Marks the BRIEF as a historical snapshot, not a working doc. Always `true` -- the BRIEF is archeological by design. |

## Source Behaviors

- **`file`** -- Brief copied from an external file path. `original_path` records where it came from.
- **`text`** -- Brief provided as inline text in the bootstrap invocation.
- **`folder`** -- Brief synthesized from multiple markdown files in a folder.
- **`interview`** -- Brief synthesized from a bootstrap interview session (greenfield+empty mode).
- **`pitch`** -- Brief authored by pitch at project scale (discovery already done; bootstrap interviews for gaps only).

When the brief already exists at `docs/BRIEF.md` within the project, use it in place -- do not copy or overwrite. Add frontmatter if missing.
