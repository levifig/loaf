  Discovers and maintains strategic context in STRATEGY.md. Use when the user
  asks "what's our strategy?" or "update the strategic direction." Produces
  personas, market landscape analysis, and problem space definitions. Not for

## Critical Rules

- **Interview deeply** -- strategy is domain knowledge extraction, not guesswork
- **Align with VISION** -- strategy serves the north star, never contradicts it
- **Get approval** -- do NOT update STRATEGY.md without explicit user confirmation
- **Define anti-personas** -- who we are NOT building for is as important as who we are
- **Keep it current** -- outdated strategy is worse than no strategy
- **Log updates** -- log strategic changes to session journal: `loaf session log "decision(strategy): updated personas/landscape/problem space"`

---

## Verification

- STRATEGY.md content aligns with VISION.md direction
- All persona definitions include anti-personas (who we are NOT building for)
- User has explicitly approved all updates before STRATEGY.md is modified

---

## Purpose

STRATEGY.md captures the **landscape** -- who we're building for, what we understand about the problem space, and how we're positioned.

Distinct from:
- **VISION.md** -- Where we're going (north star)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** -- How we build (technical constraints)

## Mode Detection

| Input Pattern | Mode |
|---------------|------|
| Empty or "discover" | Full Discovery |
| "personas" | Persona Discovery |
| "market" or "landscape" | Market Analysis |
| "problems" or "problem-space" | Problem Space |
| "glossary" | Domain Glossary |
| Specific topic | Targeted Update |

---

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. Read VISION.md (strategy must align)
2. Read existing STRATEGY.md (extend, don't duplicate)
3. Check recent sessions for implementation learnings

### Step 2: Interview Deeply

Strategy discovery requires **extensive interviewing**. Use `AskUserQuestion` frequently. Ask non-obvious questions about users, competitors, problem space, and domain language.

**Full Discovery** covers: users/personas, problem space, market landscape, domain language.

**Focused modes** drill into the specific area (personas, market, problems, or glossary).

### Step 3: Draft Updates

Create additions/updates to STRATEGY.md following the [strategy template](../skills/strategy/templates/strategy.md).

### Step 4: Present for Approval

Present proposed sections. **Do NOT update STRATEGY.md without explicit approval.**

User may: approve, adjust, add context, or request more discovery.

### Step 5: Update STRATEGY.md

After approval: create (if new) or merge content. Announce updated sections.

## Guardrails

1. **Interview deeply** -- strategy is domain knowledge extraction
2. **Align with VISION** -- strategy serves the north star
3. **Define anti-personas** -- who we're NOT building for
4. **Adjacent problems** -- document what's out of scope
5. **Get approval** -- don't update without confirmation
6. **Keep it current** -- outdated strategy is worse than none
