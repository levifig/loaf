  Maps project-management/v1 operations to Linear issue semantics through an
  exposed harness-native connection. Use when the selected canonical tracker is
  Linear. Produces verified native outcomes without configuring credentials or a
  provider client.
version: 0.6.0-rc.1

# Linear

Apply [`project-management/v1`](../project-management/contract.json) through a Linear-capable connection already exposed by the current harness. The [capability mapping](capabilities.json) describes semantic ceilings; the runtime connection decides which operations are actually available.

## Critical Rules

- Discover exposed Linear connections and verify the workspace and team before mutation. Do not assume a connection or destination from the provider name.
- Inspect runtime capabilities and downgrade unavailable mappings to `advisory`, `manual`, or `unsupported` truthfully.
- Resolve native identifiers through reads and retain the exact issue reference returned by Linear.
- Read the current issue and relevant workspace metadata before writing; re-read the issue after writing.
- Treat description, parent/children, relations, workflow state, and comments as different native semantics.
- Never install a connector, request or store credentials, construct a provider client, or bypass the harness connection.
- Never blindly repeat issue creation or comment append after an ambiguous response.
- Return the common result envelope instead of provider-shaped success claims.

## Verification

- The selected connection was observed in the current harness and its Linear workspace/team scope was read.
- Every requested operation maps to all visible runtime capabilities named by the `before`, `execute`, and `after` phases in `capabilities.json`.
- A mutation is `confirmed` only when the final native read shows the intended state.
- Missing relation, hierarchy, status, or comment capabilities are reported rather than represented in another field.
- No connection configuration, credential material, provider transport, or local work copy was created.

## Quick Reference

| Common semantic | Linear semantic | Required runtime capability phases |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Work | Issue | Search/read before create, mutate, then issue readback |
| Definition | Issue description | Issue read, description write, then issue readback |
| Hierarchy | Parent and children | Parent and child reads around parent mutation |
| Dependency | Issue relations | Relation read around relation mutation |
| Status | Issue workflow state | Current state and workflow choices around transition |
| Comment | Issue comments | Current issue/comments before append and both reads after |

Capability identifiers in the mapping describe Linear semantics, not universal harness tool names. The selected connection must expose equivalent capabilities at runtime.
