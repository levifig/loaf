  Triages private sparks and ideas plus existing native tracker candidates
  without creating a local intake queue. Use when publishing intent to Backlog,
  or when deciding which existing records should advance, defer, close, or
  return to discovery. Produces verified native dispositions and explicit gaps.

# Triage

Operate through [`project-management/v1`](../project-management/SKILL.md). Triage owns two jobs: dispose existing native candidates, and deliberately publish private sparks or ideas as public Backlog intent. It does not maintain a parallel Loaf queue or invent universal workflow states.

## Critical Rules

- As the first action, run `loaf journal log "skill(triage): <concise intent>"` against the current private local journal. If the write fails, report the failure and continue only when the work can safely proceed; never put invocation bookkeeping in the tracker.
- Confirm the exact native destination and candidate references before reading or mutating.
- Read each candidate, its current workflow state, and relevant recent comments before deciding.
- An unrecorded raw direction stays a spark or idea, goes to pitch, or is published as tracker Backlog intent when the human chooses. Do not capture it in a local issue or intake ledger. Publishing creates a native record in the uncommitted lane (GitHub: destination Project Status Backlog; Linear: the team's uncommitted/backlog state, or Triage inbox when that inbox is configured), then resolves the private capture against that native id.
- Base dispositions on evidence, strategic fit supplied by the user or project context, duplication, readiness, and blockers.
- Prefer the next complete rideable operator journey over isolated component layers. If a candidate is foundation work, retain its explicit link to the immediate journey that consumes it; triage does not invent or shape that journey.
- Read valid native workflow states before any transition. Never assume names such as backlog, canceled, or done exist.
- Use comments only to explain a disposition when collaboration benefits; the native state and fields carry the disposition itself.
- Re-read every changed candidate and return partial or unsupported results independently.

## Verification

- Every candidate disposition names its native reference and observed starting state.
- Every mutation used a runtime-supported provider operation and was verified by readback.
- No candidate disappeared because one independent mutation failed.
- Ambiguous destination, permissions, or workflow mapping is reported without mutation.
- The final result distinguishes advanced, deferred, closed, unchanged, failed, and indeterminate records in provider-native terms.
- Comparisons distinguish complete operator outcomes from enabling layers without treating foundation depth as product progress.

## Quick Reference

| Evidence | Disposition |
|----------|-------------|
| Private spark or idea worth sharing | Publish as Backlog intent; resolve the capture against the native id |
| Private spark or idea not worth sharing | Keep private or archive |
| Problem still unclear | Return to pitch |
| Narrative clear, not selected | Advance to shape; do not move to Todo unless the human selects it |
| Duplicate or superseded | Use supported native fields/state and explain with evidence |
| Blocked by missing decision | Preserve native state or use a supported deferred state |
| Ready, shaped, and selected | Leave canonical fields intact; hand to implement |
