  Conducts problem discovery before work is shaped. Use when a direction is
  still solution-led, ambiguous, or missing affected people and desired
  outcomes. Produces a complete problem narrative for shape, not a work
  implementation.

# Pitch

Discover the problem with the user, then render the [problem narrative](templates/problem-narrative.md). Pitch may read relevant native tracker context through [`project-management/v1`](../project-management/SKILL.md), but it does not mint a substitute work record.

## Critical Rules

- As the first action, run `loaf journal log "skill(pitch): <concise intent>"` against the current private local journal. If the write fails, report the failure and continue only when the work can safely proceed; never put invocation bookkeeping in the tracker.
- Ask one consequential question at a time. Include a recommendation when choices have meaningful tradeoffs.
- Stay in the problem space until affected people, current reality, desired outcome, constraints, and important unknowns are explicit.
- Seek the first rideable journey: identify the smallest useful end-to-end change for a real operator without designing it. Sequence useful outcomes, never storage, backend, API, UI, or verification layers.
- Treat a proposed solution as evidence about the problem, not as an accepted implementation.
- Read an existing native record when the user supplies a reference or when duplicate context materially affects the pitch.
- Do not create shared work during pitch unless the human explicitly says to file it. That publish is the triage action: a native intent record in Backlog, not Todo. Otherwise fill an existing native record or hand the narrative and destination uncertainty to shape. Discovery may keep a solution as a hypothesis; speculative is not authorized.
- Render the narrative with the template's headings and completed prose. Omit template field-marker comments and authoring instructions from chat responses and saved narratives; the markers belong only in the template source.
- Read [Interview Guide](references/interview-guide.md) when the initial request is solution-heavy or crosses several problem domains.

## Verification

- Every required problem-narrative field is filled with observed or explicitly uncertain information.
- The narrative explains who is affected and what changes if the problem is solved.
- The first useful operator journey is nameable, and any sequencing is expressed as outcomes rather than component layers.
- Proposed implementation details are separated from constraints and evidence.
- Existing tracker context is attributed to its native reference and has not been copied into a second work authority.
- The handoff states whether shape should create a native record, update an existing one, or leave an unshaped Backlog intent in place.

## Quick Reference

| Signal | Next question |
|--------|---------------|
| Solution first | What failure or unmet need makes this solution attractive? |
| Broad audience | Who feels the problem most directly? |
| Vague success | What observable reality would be different? |
| Conflicting goals | Which outcome wins, and why? |
| Existing native reference | What does the current record already establish? |
| Component-layer sequence | What is the first complete journey a real operator could use? |
