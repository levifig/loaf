description: >-
  Captures ideas quickly into atomic, well-structured nuggets for later
  evaluation. Covers rapid idea documentation with context, potential value, and
  next steps. Use when capturing a new idea without deep analysis, or when the
  user asks "I have an idea" or "note this down." Produces structured idea
  files. Not for deep exploration (use brainstorm) or turning ideas into specs
  (use shape).

# Idea

Capture ideas quickly with minimal friction.

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

Ideas are raw nuggets -- unprocessed, unshaped, but worth remembering.

The goal is **speed of capture**, not thoroughness. Ideas get shaped later via `/shape`.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Parse Input

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains the idea, capture it directly.

If empty or unclear, ask **at most 2-3 questions**:

1. What's the core idea? (one sentence)
2. What problem does it solve or opportunity does it create?
3. Any immediate constraints or context?

**Keep it brief.** Don't interview extensively -- that's for `/shape`.

### Step 2: Generate Idea File

Create file in `.agents/ideas/` with format:

**Filename:** `{YYYYMMDD}-{slug}.md`

```markdown
---
captured: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
status: raw
tags: []
---

# [Idea Title]

## Nugget

[One paragraph capturing the core idea]

## Problem/Opportunity

[What this addresses -- keep brief]

## Initial Context

[Any constraints, related work, or context mentioned during capture]

---

*Captured via /idea -- shape with /shape when ready*
```

### Step 3: Infer Metadata

From the conversation, infer:

- **Title:** Clear, concise summary
- **Tags:** Optional, only if obvious (e.g., "ux", "performance", "api")
- **Related:** Link to existing ideas/specs if mentioned

**Don't ask for confirmation on metadata.** Just infer sensibly.

### Step 4: Create and Announce

1. Generate timestamp:
   ```bash
   date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
   ```

2. Create the file

3. Announce:
   ```
   Captured: .agents/ideas/{filename}.md

   When ready to develop this, use `/shape {filename}` or `/brainstorm {filename}`.
   ```

## Idea Lifecycle

```
raw -> shaping -> shaped (becomes SPEC) -> archived
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `raw` | Just captured, unprocessed |
| `shaping` | Currently being developed via /shape or /brainstorm |
| `shaped` | Converted to SPEC, idea file archived |
| `archived` | Decided not to pursue, kept for reference |

## Directory Structure

```
.agents/
  ideas/
    20260124-idea-command.md
    20260124-shape-workflow.md
    archive/
      20260115-rejected-approach.md
```

---

## Guardrails

1. **Speed over completeness** -- Capture quickly, shape later
2. **2-3 questions max** -- Don't turn this into an interview
3. **Infer, don't ask** -- Metadata should be automatic
4. **One idea per file** -- Keep them atomic
5. **No shaping here** -- That's what `/shape` is for

## Examples

### Quick capture with arguments

```
User: /idea Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

Agent: [Creates file immediately]

Captured: .agents/ideas/20260124-keyboard-shortcuts.md

When ready to develop this, use `/shape 20260124-keyboard-shortcuts` or `/brainstorm 20260124-keyboard-shortcuts`.
```

### Capture with brief interview

```
User: /idea

Agent: What's the core idea?

User: We should have a way to batch process multiple ideas at once

Agent: What problem does this solve?

User: Right now shaping is one-at-a-time, slow when you have many ideas queued

Agent: [Creates file]

Captured: .agents/ideas/20260124-batch-idea-processing.md
```
